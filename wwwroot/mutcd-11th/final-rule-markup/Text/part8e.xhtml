	<p>572. In Section 8E.01 (existing Section 8D.01) Purpose, FHWA proposes to include sidewalks in the provisions in Chapter 8E (existing Chapter 8D).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Figure 8E–1 and accompanying text to illustrate and describe the difference between a pathway grade crossing and a sidewalk grade crossing. FHWA proposes these changes, as well as the following proposed changes in Chapter 8E, because additional focus has been placed on accessibility for all modes of travel at grade crossings, and as ridership has increased on light rail, commuter rail, and passenger rail facilities, pedestrian interaction with trains has led to an increasing trend in pedestrian and rail incidents.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The figure is adopted with revisions to the figure title to clarify its purpose. The figure is also revised to show detectable warnings consistent with all the other figures in Chapter 8E.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>574. In Section 8E.03 (existing Section 8D.03), retitled, “Pathway and Sidewalk Grade Crossing Signs and Markings,” FHWA proposes a new Guidance statement to recommend a 10-foot vertical clearance between overhead traffic control devices and the pathway surface directly under the sign or device on pathways used by equestrians.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Standard statements requiring that if overhead traffic control devices are placed above sidewalks, the clearance from the bottom edge of the device to the sidewalk surface directly under the sign or device to be at least 7 feet, and traffic control devices mounted adjacent to sidewalks that are mounted at a height of less than 7 feet must be at least 2 feet laterally offset from the sidewalk. FHWA proposes this change to incorporate existing provisions of Parts 2 and 4, which require a minimum mounting height of 7 feet when a traffic control device extends above the sidewalk. Restatement of these provisions within Part 8 is necessary to minimize situations where pedestrians may hit their heads and become injured while walking under a sign, signal, or other device.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The first proposed new Standard statement is adopted as proposed. The second proposed new Standard statement is adopted as Guidance to be consistent with Guidance statements regarding sign mounting height and lateral offset in Sections 2A.14 and 2A.15.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Guidance and Option statements for utilizing and mounting the LOOK (R15–8) sign and the Skewed Crossing (W10–12) sign.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance and Option statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes accompanying revised and new figures to illustrate the application of signing and pavement markings for pathways and sidewalk grade crossings.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes all of the changes in this section to be consistent with other areas of the MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The figures are adopted with revisions to clarify the arrangement of detectable warning, stop line, and other traffic control devices, and to delete references to 12-foot clearance, consistent with the text edits in Part 8.</p>

	<p>576. In Section 8E.05 (existing Section 8D.05), retitled, “Passive Traffic Control Devices—Crossbuck Assemblies,” FHWA proposes changes to the Standard paragraph, requiring a Crossbuck Assembly to be installed on each approach to the pathway or sidewalk grade crossing when the nearest edge of a pathway or sidewalk grade crossing is located more than 25 feet from the center of the nearest traffic control warning device at a grade crossing.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>578. In Section 8E.07 (existing Section 8D.06), retitled, “Active Traffic Control Systems,” FHWA proposes new Standard paragraphs and accompanying revised figure requiring an active traffic control system at pathway-LRT and sidewalk-LRT grade crossings where LRT operating speeds on a semi-exclusive alignment exceed 25 mph.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement is adopted with revisions to reorder the paragraphs to improve the clarity of the requirements. The Standard regarding audible devices is revised to a Guidance statement to be consistent with other statements regarding audible devices in Part 4 and Part 8.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard requiring an active traffic control system, including automatic gates at pathway-LRT and sidewalk-LRT grade crossings where LRT operating speeds on a semi- exclusive alignment exceed 40 mph. Both proposed new Standards include an exception to omit flashing- light signals, bells, and other audible warning devices when the pathway or sidewalk grade crossing is located within 25 feet of an active warning device that is equipped with those devices.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option statement that allows additional pairs of flashing-light signals, bells, or other audible warning devices to be installed on the active traffic control devices at a grade crossing for pathway or sidewalk users approaching the grade crossing from the back side of those devices.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes a new Guidance statement recommending that if there is space, a pedestrian refuge area or island should be provided between the tracks and the roadway where railroad or LRT tracks in a semi-exclusive alignment are immediately adjacent to a roadway.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted with editorial revisions to clarify the applicability of the statement.</p>

	<p>579. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 8E.08 Active Traffic Control Devices— Signals,” for pedestrian signal heads, flashing red lights, and other active traffic control devices at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings. Some of the material in this section was relocated from existing Section 8C.13 and has been reorganized to provide all relevant information for flashing-light signals at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings in one section.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted with revisions as described below.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes new Standard and Support paragraphs that prohibit the use of pedestrian signal heads at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings. FHWA proposes the change to improve pedestrian safety and prevent user confusion at grade crossings.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard and Support statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option statement that allows the use of pedestrian signal heads at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings with LRT. FHWA proposes the change to provide agencies with flexibility where the LRT movements are controlled by a traffic signal.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standards for flashing-light signals at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings. FHWA proposes the changes to provide uniformity in the design and operation of flashing-light signals.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance statement for use of pedestrian gates in situations where flashing- light signals have not been effective. FHWA proposes the change to improve pedestrian safety at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is revised to replace references to an engineering study with references to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Section 8A.03 and 8A.05.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA also proposes changes to an existing Guidance statement to clarify that flashing-light signals are recommended along semi-exclusive LRT alignments. FHWA proposes the change to improve pedestrian safety at LRT grade crossings which typically have much higher volumes of pedestrians and rail traffic.</p>

	</span>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>580. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 8E.09 Active Traffic Control Devices— Automatic Pedestrian Gates,” for the design, utilization, and implementation of automatic pedestrian gates including accompanying figures. Some of the material in this section was relocated from existing Section 8D.06 and has been reorganized to provide all relevant information for automatic gates at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings in one section.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted with revisions as described herein.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Standard statement to require automatic pedestrian gates, swing gates and fencing for pathway and sidewalk grade crossings where trains are permitted to travel 80 miles per hour and higher. FHWA proposes this change for pedestrian safety at grade crossings where higher speed trains operate.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement is revised to replace references to an engineering study with references to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Section 8A.03 and 8A.05.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance statement to recommend an emergency escape route at automatic pedestrian gates. FHWA proposes this change to reflect industry best practices in the design of automatic pedestrian gates.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standards to require at least one red light on the automatic pedestrian gate arm and if there is more than one red light, they must be flashed in an alternating pattern.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option to omit the red light if the pathway or sidewalk crossing is within 25 feet of the roadway grade crossing. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with Section 8D.03, while providing agencies flexibility where the pathway or sidewalk grade crossing is in close proximity to automatic gates for the roadway grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option statement to clarify that a separate pedestrian gate is not required if the vehicular gate mechanism does not allow it to be raised by a pedestrian raising the pedestrian gate arm based on Official Ruling No. 8(09)–3(I) (<a href ="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_3.htm">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_3.htm</a>).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes new Option and Guidance statements to provide information about the use of horizontal hanging bars from a pedestrian gate arm.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed. The Guidance statement is revised to specify 26 inches as the maximum height of the horizontal hanging bar based on the research completed to date and input from the U.S. Access Board. This revision to the maximum height has also been incorporated in Figure
8E-12.</p>
