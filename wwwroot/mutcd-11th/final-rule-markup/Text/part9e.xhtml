	<div class="npa">
	<p>623. In Section 9E.01 (part of existing Section 9C.04), retitled, “Bicycle Lanes,” FHWA proposes to revise the Standard to require the use of bicycle lane symbol or word markings, in addition to longitudinal pavement markings, to define bicycle lanes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted with edits as described herein.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes these changes to inform road users of the bicycle lane and to reduce wrong-way bicycling.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes adding clarification to the Guidance regarding the placement of the first symbol or word denoting a bicycle lane. This proposed change makes the bicycle markings consistent with preferential lane word and symbol markings.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option allowing the use of arrow markings in conjunction with the bicycle lane symbol or word markings.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a revision to Figure 9E-1 to include a single symbol for bicycle symbol pavement markings to enable a single symbol used for bicycle signs and pavement markings thereby enhancing uniformity and recognition of bicycle symbols.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add a Standard prohibiting the bicycle symbol or BIKE LANE pavement word marking and the pavement marking arrow in a shoulder.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to require that a portion of the travel way cannot be established as both a shoulder and a bicycle lane because each serves a different use and has differing regulations that apply. The uniform marking of each type would minimize any confusion and accommodate the expectancy of the road user.</p>

	</span>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>624. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9E.02 Bicycle Lanes at Intersection Approaches,” which contains material from existing Section 9C.04.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Section is adopted with edits as described herein.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Option statement to allow a bicycle lane to be located on the outside of a turn lane if a bicycle signal face is used and the signal phasing and signing eliminates potential conflicts.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard that requires bicycle lanes located at an intersection approach between contiguous lanes for motor vehicle movements be marked with a bicycle symbol and arrow pavement markings.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard to prohibit bicycle lanes from being marked as contiguous with a general-purpose turn lane, either with dotted or any other line markings. FHWA proposes these additions to alert motor vehicles of the presence of bicyclists and prevent potential conflicts.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes Option, Guidance, and Support statements for shifting over of buffer separated or separated bike lanes at intersections to improve visibility for motor vehicles and bicycles to account for developments in bicycle facility design since 2009 edition of the MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes new Option, Standard, and Support statements and a new figure to provide an option and requirements for the use of mixing zones, which are when general purpose and bike lanes must share the same space through an intersection.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted with edits to clarify the use of markings in mixing zones with a yielding area.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comment, a new Standard is adopted that through bicycle movements shall not be accommodated in a general-purpose turn lane controlled by a traffic signal unless the turning movement is always permitted to proceed simultaneously with the adjacent through movement.</p>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>In the NPA, FHWA proposed to add Support, Option, and Guidance statements in Section 9E.02 related to the shifting of buffer-separated or separated bicycle lanes. The Option allows for bicycle lanes to be shifted closer to or further away from the adjacent general-purpose lane. The Guidance indicates the bicycle lanes should not be shifted away from the general-purpose lane unless there is sufficient space for a vehicle to queue between the general-purpose lane and extension of the bicycle lane.</p>

	<p>Many commenters opposed the Guidance statement that a buffer-separated or separated bicycle lane should not be shifted away from the adjacent general-purpose lane at an intersection unless there is sufficient space for a vehicle to queue between the general-purpose lane and the extension of the bicycle lane. Commenters stated that it went counter to best practices and there was sufficient experience to show it to be safe practice. In consideration of the comments received and further review, FHWA is not adopting this proposed Guidance statement. Rather, FHWA is adding a Support statement that shifting a bicycle lane away from a general-purpose lane at an intersection can create space for vehicles to queue and has safety benefits. This change provides more flexibility and FHWA believes these provisions will help strengthen the protection of vulnerable users consistent with section 11135 of BIL.</p>

	<h3 id="section9E03">Section 9E.03 Extensions of Bicycle Lanes through Intersections</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>625. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9E.03 Extensions of Bicycle Lanes through Intersections” to provide Support, Standard, Guidance, and Option statements on the application of bicycle lane extensions.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Section is adopted with changes as described herein.</p>

	<p>In this section, FHWA proposes to clarify that shared-lane markings and chevrons shall not be used through intersections. This is not a new Standard, rather a clarification of the Standard in existing Section 9C.07 and of the use of chevrons.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A commenter suggested that use of chevron markings be allowed, due to their lower cost and durability; however, FHWA retains this restriction, because the chevron markings in bicycle applications have a designated use and meaning, and the use of chevrons alone has not been demonstrated to be effective.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes new Standard statements requiring only dotted lane lines for extensions of bike lanes
through intersections and requiring lane extension markings to extend buffer separated or separated bicycle lanes through intersections and driveways. As part of these changes, FHWA proposes Support and Guidance statements regarding pavement markings for bicycle lanes through intersections.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard to use dotted lane patterns for extensions of bike lanes through intersections, when marked, is adopted as proposed. Based on comments, the provisions on the use of lane extension markings to extend buffer-separated or separated bicycle lanes through intersections and driveways are adopted as Guidance rather than Standard, since engineering judgement should be used to determine where lane extension markings are needed.</p>
	
	<p>FHWA also adds a Standard requiring the lateral limits of bicycle lane extensions through intersections when the bicycle lane is contiguous to a crosswalk.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">This Standard is adopted as proposed. A commenter suggested deleting this Standard because it restricts the ability to align green bicycle lane extensions with ladder bar crosswalks. FHWA notes that the dotted line establishes the bicycle lane extension, and the green-colored pavement supplements the extension markings; the optional broken green-colored pattern is not intended to align with crosswalk marking patterns, as the two markings and areas are for completely separate uses.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes this new section because the uniform application of extensions of bicycle lanes through intersections assists all users of the intersection in identifying where bicyclists are expected to operate.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>629. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9E.07 Separated Bicycle Lanes” to provide Support, Standard, Option, and Guidance statements, along with a new figure, for the application of separated bicycle lanes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Section is adopted with a modifications as described herein.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes Standard statements requiring a buffer space between parking spaces and separated bicycle lanes, buffer space markings, restrictions for edge line and lane line colors, and requiring directional arrows.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments suggesting that more flexibility is needed, the proposed Standard is adopted as Guidance to recommend, rather than require, a buffer space between a parking lane and bicycle lane when the parking lane serves as a separation between a general-purpose lane and a separated bicycle lane.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Standards related to requirements for signalization with two-way separated bicycle lanes and prohibiting right turns on red across separated bicycle lanes when bicycle traffic is allowed to proceed through the intersection.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The turn-on-red prohibition Standard is adopted with modifications, and the signalization requirements content is moved to Chapter to 4H, with clarifying reference to Section 4H.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes this new section to provide practitioners information for uniformity in application to promote the safe and efficient operation of the bicycle lanes by reducing conflicts between bicycles and pedestrians accessing parked vehicles, and between bicycles and motor vehicles turning across their path on separate traffic signal phases.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>630. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9E.08 Counter-Flow Bicycle Lanes” to provide Support, Standard, and Guidance statements, along with a new figure, for the application of counter-flow bicycle lanes, which is when one direction bicycle lanes travel the opposite direction of the general traffic that is also traveling in one direction.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Section is adopted with modifications.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of the proposed Standard requiring counterflow bicycle lanes not to be placed between parking lanes and general-purpose lanes.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes Guidance to recommend that a counter-flow bicycle lane be placed on the right-hand side of the road with opposing traffic on the left.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard requiring double yellow line markings, a painted median island, raised median island, or some form of physical separation to define the counter-flow bicycle lane where the speed limit is 30 mph or less.</p>

	<p>When the speed limit is 35 mph or greater, FHWA proposes a Standard requiring a buffer, a painted median, raised median island, or another form of physical separation to ensure safe operation through adequate separation between opposing flows of bicycles and motor vehicles.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes new Standards and Guidance for required and recommended signing and signalization for counter-flow bicycle lanes. FHWA proposes this new section to provide practitioners information for uniformity in application.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="fr">
	<p>In the proposed new Section 9E.08 Counter-Flow Bicycle Lanes, FHWA proposed a Standard prohibiting locating a counter-flow bicycle lane between the general-purpose lane and on-street parallel parking lane for motor vehicles. This prohibition was added due to safety concerns for bicyclists as a motorist may not have line of sight of oncoming bicyclists when maneuvering their parked vehicle to reenter the general-purpose travel way, which would require crossing the counter-flow bicycle lane with potentially very limited visibility.</p>

	<p>Commenters suggested that the proposed Standard which would prohibit locating a counter-flow bike lane between a general-purpose lane and an on-street parallel parking lane would preclude situations when it is impractical to locate the lane elsewhere, such as between the curb and the parking lane. Commenters further suggested that locating the counter-flow bicycle lane between a general-purpose lane and an on-street parking lane has been done in a number of municipalities without documented safety issues.</p>

	<p>The FHWA agrees that there may be situations where it would be impractical to locate a counter-flow elsewhere as local agencies may have limited options for creating and maintaining connected bicycle networks. However, placing bicycle lanes between the curb and an on-street parallel parking lane provides bicyclists a buffer from motor vehicle traffic to improve safety. Considering this, FHWA changes this Standard to Guidance, which will allow for engineering judgment or study to determine when it might be necessary to locate a counter-flow bike lane adjacent to the general-purpose lane. The FHWA believes this provides sufficient flexibility to agencies in designing their bicycle facilities while meeting FHWA's statutory obligation under Section 11135 of BIL to provide for the protection of vulnerable road users.</p>

	<p>631. In Section 9E.09 (existing Section 9C.07) Shared- Lane Marking, FHWA proposes to revise the Guidance to recommend that shared-lane markings not be used on roadways with a posted speed limit of 40 mph or above, instead of above 35 mph per the 2009 version of the Manual.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments, the list of Options where shared-lane markings may be used is expanded to clarify they may be used to assist bicyclists with lateral positioning in mixing zones.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Standard to expand the listing of locations where shared-lane markings are prohibited. FHWA proposes this change to include some of the new applications that are proposed in this NPA but are not in the 2009 Edition of the Manual, and to address field experience with this marking since it was adopted in the 2009 MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed. Comments suggested deleting the restriction for use of green-colored pavement as a background to shared-lane markings. In accordance with Part 3, green-colored pavement is used only to enhance conspicuity of bicycle lanes. It is not used in shared facilities, including shared-lane markings. To address concerns expressed by commentes about contrast, an Option consistent with Part 3 is added for black-colored markings, which may be used to improve contrast.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA provides new Guidance statements on the placement of shared-lane markings and the use of Bicycles Allowed Use of Full Lane (R9-20, redesignated from R4–11) signs.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes new Options and an associated figure, for implementation of shared-lane markings in places where the width of the roadway is insufficient to continue a bike lane or separate bikeway on approach to the intersection.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted with minor editorial changes.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes this new section to provide practitioners discretion when developing a policy for the use of the shared-lane markings on intersection approaches.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>633. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9E.11 Two-Stage Bicycle Turn Boxes” to provide Support, Standard, Option, and Guidance statements, as well as two new figures, to describe the application of two-stage bicycle turn boxes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Section is adopted as proposed with a minor editorial change.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes Standards to provide requirements on location, pavement markings, arrows, and passive detection of bicycles at traffic signals. As two stage bicycle turn boxes are intended to be positioned within an intersection for bicyclists to queue safely, these Standards define what is required to make those spaces both safe and operationally effective for bicyclists at traffic signals.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes Guidance to consider the peak hour bicycle demand and adjacent land uses for the size of the bicycle turn box.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes an Option to use green colored pavement with an associated Standard that requires the entire turn box to be green colored pavement when used.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes a Standard that requires a full-time turns-on-red prohibition where the path of vehicles lawfully turning right on red would pass through the bicycle turn box.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes this section to describe the proper use of this new application that simplifies the turning task for bicyclists.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>638. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9E.17 Raised Devices” to provide Support, Option, Standard, and Guidance statements for the application of raised devices in coordination with bicycle facilities.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Section is adopted with an added Support provision, in response to comment, describing measures to reduce the likelihood of a road user striking a channelizing device.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a Standard that channelizing devices shall not incorporate the color green, consistent with an existing requirement in Part 3 that the color of channelizing devices shall match the color of the pavement markings they supplement. FHWA proposes this requirement to reiterate the existing requirement because some bicycle facilities utilize optional green colored pavement to supplement the required white or yellow markings and the existing requirement could imply that the color of the channelizing devices are allowed to match the color of the pavement (green, in this case) rather than the color of the pavement marking. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Guidance statements that the channelizing devices should be tubular markers, and that the selection of a raised device consider the collision potential of both the post and the base.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes Guidance to recommend that if used in buffer separated bicycle lanes, channelizing devices should be placed in the buffer space and at least one foot from the longitudinal bicycle lane pavement marking.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes this new section because the purpose of channelizing devices is to emphasize pavement marking patterns associated with bicycle
facilities.
