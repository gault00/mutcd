	<p>364. In Section 3G.03 (existing Section 3F.03), retitled, “Application,” FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph recommending using delineators of the appropriate color to indicate lane- reduction transitions where either an outside or inside lane merges into an adjacent lane. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency in the application of delineators proposed in other Sections.
