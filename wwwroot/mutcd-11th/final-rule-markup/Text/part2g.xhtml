	<p>Chapter 2G organization (not discussed in the NPA Preamble)</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Chapter 2G is reorganized with adoption of sub-chapter headings to improve usability of the MUTCD as follows: General; Regulatory Signs; Warning Signs and Plaque; Guide Signs; and Managed Lane Signs, Plaques, and Lane-Use Control Signals.</p>

    <h3 id="section2G01">Section 2G.01 Scope</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>242. In Section 2G.01 Scope, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard statement excluding bike lanes from the provisions of the Chapter unless otherwise provided. FHWA proposes this change because, in general, information specific to bike lanes is included in Part 9.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted as proposed with a minor editorial change replacing “bike lane” with “bicycle lane” for consistency with terminology used throughout the Manual.</p>
	</div>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes are lanes designated for special traffic uses such as high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), light rail, buses, <span class="text_added change_from_npa">or </span>taxis<span class="text_deleted change_from_npa">, or bicycles</span>. Preferential lane treatments might be as simple as restricting a turning lane to a certain class of vehicles during peak periods, or as sophisticated as providing a separate roadway system within a highway corridor for certain vehicles.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes might be barrier-separated (on a separate alignment or physically separated from the other travel lanes by a barrier or median), buffer-separated (separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes only by a narrow buffer area created with longitudinal pavement markings), or contiguous (separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes only by a lane line). Preferential lanes might allow continuous access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes or restrict access only to designated locations. Preferential lanes might be operated in a constant direction or operated as reversible lanes. Some reversible preferential lanes on a divided highway might be operated counter-flow to the direction of traffic on the immediately adjacent general-purpose lanes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para03">03</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes might be operated on a 24-hour basis, for extended periods of the day, during peak travel periods only, during special events, or during other activities.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para04">04</span><span class="support">Open-road tolling lanes and toll plaza lanes that segregate traffic based on payment method are not considered preferential lanes. Chapter 2F contains information regarding signing of open-road tolling lanes and toll plaza lanes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para05">05</span><span class="support">Managed lanes typically restrict access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes to designated locations only.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para06">06</span><span class="support">Under certain operational strategies, such as the occupancy requirement of an HOV lane changing in response to actual congestion levels, a managed lane is a special type of preferential lane (see <a href="#section2G03">Sections 2G.03</a> through <a href="#section2G07">2G.07</a>).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para07">07</span><span class="support">A managed lane operated on a real-time basis in response to changing conditions might be operated as an HOV lane for a period of time as needed to manage congestion levels.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section2G03">Section 2G.03 Regulatory Signs for Preferential Lanes – General</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>243. In Section 2G.03 Regulatory Signs for Preferential Lanes—General, FHWA proposes to revise Option P14 to increase the minimum vertical clearance from
14 feet to 17 feet for post-mounted preferential lane regulatory signs on a median barrier where lateral clearance is limited. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with Standard P15 which references a requirement in Section 2A.18 to provide a 17-foot minimum vertical clearance for overhead signs that are over the lane or shoulder. FHWA proposes similar changes in 2G.08, “Warning Signs on Median Barriers for Preferential Lanes,” and Section 2G.10,
“Preferential Lane Guide Signs—General.’
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed. In addition, several cross-reference citations have been updated.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete Option P19 and Standard P20 allowing the HOV abbreviation or the diamond symbol on signs because all the standard signs for HOV lanes include the diamond symbol and therefore the option is not needed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to relocate paragraphs 23 through 26 from Section 2G.03 to Section 2G.16.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>244. In Section 2G.04 retitled, “Vehicle Occupancy Definition Signs (R3–10 Series and R3–13 Series),” FHWA proposes to remove Guidance paragraphs 4 and 5, because the legend format of these signs is standardized and must comply with existing requirements of Chapter 2A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change the Standards in paragraphs 9 and 10 and add an Option to allow, rather than require, the placement interval of 1⁄2 mile for R3–11a and R3–10 signs along the length of an HOV lane where access is denied, to provide agencies greater flexibility.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed with a minor edit changing the name of the R3-11a sign from “Periods of Operation” to “Preferential Lane Operation.”</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to revise the last Guidance statement to specify that the Preferential Lane regulatory sign sequence spacing of 800 to 1,000 feet is applicable to freeways and expressways and proposes to recommend that sign spacing on conventional roads should be determined by engineering judgment based on speed, block length, distances from adjacent intersections, and other site- specific considerations.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>245. In Section 2G.05 retitled, “Preferential Lane Operation Signs (R3– 11 Series, R3–14 Series),” FHWA proposes to change the Guidance statement regarding the size of post mounted R3–11 series signs to a Support statement to describe why the sizes are standardized.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement regarding increasing the height of the R3–11 series signs for locations where regulations are in place more than one time period of the day to accommodate additional lines of legend.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to change the requirement to show 24 HOURS when a preferential lane restriction is in effect on a full-time basis to an Option. FHWA proposes this change because typically traffic regulations are assumed to be in effect on a full-time basis. However, FHWA retains the option to use the 24 HOURS legend because there are situations where it is necessary to reinforce that a restriction is in place at all times as part of a change in operation or where several facilities in the same area have different hours of operation.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Option statement that allows the use of post-mounted Periods of Operation (R3–11 series) signs instead of overhead Periods of Operation (R3–14 series) signs on conventional roads with preferential lane operations. FHWA proposes this option to provide clarity to an existing provision.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete existing Guidance P13 recommending the use of overhead or post-mounted Period of Operations signs at periodic intervals along the length of a contiguous or buffer-separated preferential lane where continuous access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes is provided, because the use of these signs is required in the Section 2G.05
Standard.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to delete existing Option P15 regarding the use of overhead Periods of Operation (R3–14 series) signs at the beginning or entry points and/or at intermediate points along preferential lanes on conventional roads, because stating this as an Option is unnecessary.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted with a minor edit to clarify that full-time is 24-hours a day, seven days a week. Other revisions in the final rule clarify the use of a period of operation legend on Preferential Lane Operation signs.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>247. In Section 2G.11 retitled, “Signing for Initial Entry Points to Preferential Lanes,” FHWA proposes to add a new Standard to require an Advance Guide sign approximately 1 mile in advance of the entry point where a general-purpose lane becomes a preferential lane that does not provide continuous access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to require a yellow panel with black legend and border displaying a down arrow and the word ONLY on the Advance Guide and Entrance Direction signs and to add a new Figure to illustrate an example of these signs. FHWA proposes this change to provide road users with sufficient advance notice to change lanes if they desire to continue in the general-purpose lanes, consistent with signing for dropped lanes at interchanges.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to indicate that several of the Standards and Guidance in this section apply to freeways and expressways, because such provisions are not appropriate for conventional roads.</p>

	<p>247. In Section 2G.17 (existing Section 2G.16) Signs for Priced Managed Lanes—General, FHWA proposes to delete the last Standard statement regarding the use of the diamond symbol because it is redundant with the provisions of Section 2G.03.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted as proposed.</p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para01">01</span><span class="support">A priced managed lane is a managed lane that employs tolling or pricing, typically through electronic toll collection, to manage congestion levels and maintain a certain level of service for users of the facility. A priced managed facility typically provides a less congested alternative to adjacent lanes along the same designated route, or to a nearby facility, that experience recurring congestion during peak periods. A priced managed lane might allow non-toll travel by certain vehicles based on occupancy or other criteria. A variety of operational management strategies might be used in conjunction with tolling or pricing.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para02">02</span><span class="support">The number and combination of operational strategies that are applied to a managed lane to manage congestion or improve efficiency might be practically limited by the amount of information that can be legibly displayed on signs or in signing sequences and still be readily comprehended by road users. Such factors to consider when evaluating alternatives for managed lanes are locations of signs for general-purpose interchanges and for other roadway conditions, the number of intermediate access points between the managed and general-purpose lanes and the need to repeat the operational information, and the distance over which a signing sequence that displays all of the eligibility requirements can be displayed.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para03">03</span><span class="support">Because managed lanes have the capability to employ a variety of operational strategies on a changing basis, it is not practical to assign a naming convention to such lanes for the purpose of signing based on the specific operational management strategies, as is more readily accomplished with other types of preferential lanes, such as HOV, <span class="text_deleted change_from_npa">B</span><span class="text_added change_from_npa">b</span>us, or <span class="text_deleted change_from_npa">Bike</span><span class="text_added change_from_npa">bicycle</span> lanes. Instead, the various requirements, restrictions, and eligibility criteria are more appropriately conveyed through a sequence of regulatory and guide signs with a more encompassing designation for the purpose of providing directional information.</span></p>

	<p>249. In Section 2G.19 (existing Section 2G.18) Guide Signs for Priced Managed Lanes, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard statement and accompanying figure prohibiting the use of ETC-account pictographs on the primary guide sign directing traffic to the managed lane when registration in a toll-account program is not required for travel in a managed lane in which tolls are charged. In such cases, FHWA proposes that the purple header panel shall be replaced with a warning header panel with a black legend and border on yellow background displaying the word TOLL. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency in signing for toll facilities where registration is not required for travel for the purpose of improving traffic efficiency and safety.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option provision allowing the legend TOLL BILLED BY MAIL ONLY on a separate information sign within the sequence of primary guide signs in advance of an entrance to the managed lane if the managed lane does not accept toll payments from an ETC account system and collects tolls only by post travel billing of registered vehicle owners.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>250. In new Section 2G.20, Signs for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder—General, FHWA proposes to add a Support statement regarding the general applicability of part-time travel on shoulders and factors to consider when planning traffic control for such operations.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a figure showing an example of signing for part-time travel on a shoulder.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a Standard stating that shoulders open to travel on a permanent full-time basis shall be signed and marked as a standard travel lane to be consistent with other travel lanes open on a full-time basis and to accommodate the expectancy of road users.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This section and Figure are adopted as proposed.</p>

Configurations might be on freeways and expressways, as well as on conventional roads. Travel on the shoulder during these periods might be restricted to certain classes of vehicles, such as buses or HOV, or might be open to general traffic. When the part-time travel on a shoulder is limited to certain classes of vehicles, the signing is similar to that for preferential lanes. Additional signing is typically used to advise road users that the shoulder is not available for emergency use during these periods. Part-time travel on a shoulder might also employ lane-use control signals and/or blank-out signs to inform traffic of the allowable use of the shoulder. Depending on the design of exit ramp terminals and auxiliary lanes, guide signs must account for exit maneuvers during both shoulder use conditions and might necessitate changeable legend elements. However, additional guide signs are not normally necessary specifically for the condition when the shoulder is used for travel. The pavement markings might also be modified where travel allowed on the shoulder begins and ends.</span></p>

	<h3 id="section2G21">Section 2G.21 Regulatory Signs <span class="text_added change_from_npa">and Plaques </span>for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>251. In new Section 2G.21, Regulatory Signs and Plaques for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder, FHWA proposes a Standard requiring signs and plaques to notify road users of the periods of operation that travel is allowed on a paved shoulder. FHWA proposes to require the use of a Part-Time Travel on Shoulder Operation (R3–51) sign where traffic is allowed to travel on the shoulder during certain fixed periods of operation and the use of the Part-Time Travel on Shoulder Variable Operation (R3–51d) sign with two flashing beacons mounted above it when the period of operation is variable. FHWA proposes these two signs to provide road users with specific signing that distinguishes between fixed period and variable operation, along with beacons to indicate when use of the shoulders is allowed for variable operation.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to require the use of Selective Exclusion plaques to convey any restriction on certain types of vehicles.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes an Option to allow an EMERGENCY STOPPING ONLY OTHER TIMES (R3–51cP) plaque to be mounted below the R3–51 sign if the Selective Exclusion plaques are not used.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes Guidance recommending the use of the TRAVEL ON SHOULDER BEGINS 1⁄2 MILE (R3–52c) sign be used in advance of the location where part-time travel on the shoulder first begins followed by the DO NOT DRIVE ON SHOULDER (R4–17) sign appropriately spaced downstream in order to provide road users with additional information regarding the use of the shoulder.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard requiring use of the TRAVEL ON SHOULDER ENDS (R3–52a), END TRAVEL ON SHOULDER (R3–52), and DO NOT DRIVE ON SHOULDER (R4–17) signs, appropriately sequenced, to indicate the termination of the shoulder travel allowance. FHWA proposes this sequence of signs to provide consistency in signing and improve safety at all locations that allow part-time travel on shoulder by providing a common understanding of when shoulder travel is no longer allowed. FHWA also proposes Guidance regarding the BEGIN EXIT LANE (R3– 56) sign, the EMERGENCY STOPPING ONLY (R8–7) sign, and the TO TRAFFIC ON SHOULDER (R3–57P) plaque used at the beginning of deceleration lanes where traffic is allowed to enter during the periods that travel is prohibited on the shoulder, at turnouts provided for emergency stopping during periods when travel is allowed on the shoulder, and below YIELD signs where traffic on an entrance ramp is required to yield to traffic using the shoulder, respectively. FHWA proposes these recommendations to provide traffic control devices to manage traffic more effectively in these circumstances.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted as proposed. In addition, based on comments submitted in Chapter 2B, FHWA also moves a Guidance statement from Section 2B.28 regarding BEGIN RIGHT (LEFT) TURN LANE regulatory signs to this section, since the signs are only used for part-time travel on a shoulder.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>254. In new Section 2G.24, Lane-Use Control Signals for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder, FHWA proposes an Option to allow the use of overhead lane-use control signals to indicate when a shoulder is open or closed to travel.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard that when lane-use control signals are used for part-time travel on a shoulder, they shall follow the provisions of Chapter
4T; that lane-use control signals are not required to be used on adjacent travel lanes; and that a steady red X signal indication shall be used to close the shoulder to all travel except emergencies.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to require that when part-time travel on a shoulder is allowed for variable periods of operation, lane-use control signals shall be used and evenly spaced approximately evenly 1⁄2 mile or less and centered over the shoulder to indicate the status of the shoulder travel allowance.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes the use of the green down arrow during times when travel is allowed on the shoulder, a yellow X just before the shoulder is to be closed to travel, and a red X when shoulder travel is discontinued. As part of this proposal, FHWA proposes to require that during the period when the shoulder is open to travel, a lane-use control signal that continuously displays a yellow X be used approximately 1⁄2 mile in advance of the location where part-time travel on the shoulder ends, and then displays a red X when the travel on shoulder ends.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to require the use of a lane-use control signal with a red X display at all times at the location where part-time travel on the shoulder ends.</p>

	<p>For part-time travel on shoulder with variable periods of operation, FHWA proposes an Option allowing the use of post-mounted TRAVEL ON SHOULDER ALLOWED WHEN FLASHING (R3–51d) signs with flashing beacons be used lieu of the lane-use control signals at the same intervals.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes an Option allowing the use of the TRAVEL ON SHOULDER ON GREEN ARROW ONLY (R3–51e) sign with a lane use control signal. The R3–51e sign may be mounted adjacent to the signal head, elsewhere on the signal support, or post mounted next to, or in advance of, the signal. FHWA proposes these additions to provide consistency with other lane use control signal applications.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Some commenters suggested that the maximum ½-mile spacing requirement for lane-use control signals should be Guidance rather than Standard as it is too restrictive by not allowing for placement of devices around roadway features or obstacles. FHWA disagrees that the requirement is too restrictive as it is stated that the spacing be “approximately every ½ mile or less”. FHWA believes this text provides sufficient flexibility in the spacing of these devices noting that engineering judgment can be used in determining the exact spacing of individual devices in locations where ½ mile spacing is impractical.

	<h3 id="section2G26">Section 2G.26 Variable Speed Limits for Active Lane Management on Freeways and Expressways</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>256. In new Section 2G.26, Variable Speed Limits for Active Traffic Management on Freeways and Expressways, FHWA proposes a Standard requiring the regulatory speed display on a changeable speed limit signs comply with Paragraph 2 of Section 2B.22 of the MUTCD. This is proposed to ensure that variable speed limit sign designs are consistent across all roadways to improve recognition, which leads to better traffic operations and increased safety.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Guidance that the location and positioning of Variable Speed Limit signs should associate the speed displayed on them to the lane or lanes intended to be regulated to avoid potential confusion as to the applicability of the speed limit.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Guidance that variable speed limit signs, in addition to post-interchange placement, should be spaced based on an engineering study considering multiple factors including known congestion points to adjust the operating speed to minimize the extent of vehicle queuing and improve safety.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted as proposed, with an addition to the P3 Standard that includes reference to the “Standard Highway Signs” publication in addition to the MUTCD and to the P4 Guidance that includes similar guidance as Section 2E.43 establishing that variable speed limit signs should not be located on overhead guide sign installations.
