	<p>Chapter 2D organization (not discussed in the NPA Preamble)</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">As part of the reorganization to improve usability of the MUTCD, the following subchapter headings in Chapter 2D are adopted to organize sections into related groupings: General Design; Route Signs and Auxiliary Plaques; Sign Assemblies; Destination and Distance Signs; Street Name and Parking Signs; Freeway Interchange Approach Signs; Weigh Station, Crossover, Truck and Passing Lane, and Emergency and Slow Vehicle Passing Lane Signs; Other Guide Signs; and Signing at Airports.</p>

    <h3 id="section2D01">Section 2D.01 Scope of Conventional Road Guide Sign Standards<span class="text_added"> and Application</span></h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>155. In Section 2D.01 (existing Section 2D.02), retitled, “Scope of Conventional Road Guide Sign Standards and Application,” FHWA proposes to relocate existing Guidance and Support statements regarding low volume roads from Chapter 5D. FHWA proposes the change to place all related material regarding guide signs together.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Section 2D.01 title change and relocation of statements from the Part 5 of the previous Edition regarding low volume roads is adopted with a slight rearrangement in the paragraphs from what was proposed in the NPA.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance statement recommending that the primary or control destinations displayed on guide signs be meaningful to road uses in navigation and orientation, and that such destinations be identifiable on official maps. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency in the use of destinations on guide signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Support statement to indicate that guide signs, other than Street Name signs, are generally not used on low-volume rural roads, except as needed to guide road users back to major roadways.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add new Support and Guidance statements, along with a new figure, describing signing for airport facility roadways. This information is based on a study by the National Academy of Sciences (http://www.trb.org/Main/ Blurbs/165910.aspx) that examined airport roadway user informational needs and limitations.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments suggesting this material was better suited for a separate section, this information is adopted as a separate Section 2D.60 Signing at Airports in the final rule. The Guidance statement is revised in the final rule to clarify potential measures to provide road users with adequate time to comprehend and respond to signs at airports and an accompanying Support is added in the final rule.</p>

	<p>156. In Section 2D.05 (existing Section 2D.06), FHWA proposes to add a Standard statement that the minimum letter and numeral height of the principal legend on conventional road overhead signs be at least 12 inches in height for upper-case letters and 9 inches in height for lower-case letters. An Option is also proposed to allow 10.67 inches in height for upper case letters and 8 inches in height for lowercase letters for such roadways with posted speed limits of 40 miles per hour or less. FHWA proposes this change to ensure adequate letter height to meet road user legibility needs for conventional roadway overhead guide signs based on speed of travel.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Standard regarding minimum letter and numeral height of the principal legend on overhead guide signs on conventional roadways is adopted with edits in response to comments in the final rule. To align with proposed Table 2D-2, the minimum letter and numeral heights are revised to 6 inches in height for all upper-case letters, or a combination of 6 inches in height for upper-case letters and 4.5 inches in nominal loop height for lower-case letters. A qualifier was added to the standard, as existing guidance recommends larger minimum lettering and numeral sizes where conditions indicate a need for greater legibility with specific recommendations in Table 2D-2 and existing guidance specific to overhead Street Name signs in Section 2D.45. Table 2D-2 is adopted with edits in response to comments and for consistency with the adopted provisions, adding minimum and desirable minimum letter and numeral heights in the 35-55 mph column.
</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Commenters also suggested deleting any reference to the lower-case letter loop height as there have been instances in which designers incorrectly reduce the size of the lower-case letters based on an incorrect reference to the rising stroke rather than the nominal loop height. No change was adopted as this description remains important to understand the letter forms. FHWA will address the potential confusion in electronic sign design and fabrication with additional information in the <i>Standard Highway Signs</i> publication or another potential resource.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Commenters also questioned how Table 2D-2 would relate to Table 2D-1 and the associated minimum sizes of conventional road guide signs that have standardized designs. Generally, Table 2D-1 will include the minimum sign and plaque sizes applicable regardless of speed or number of lanes. The recommended increase in letter and numeral sizes included in Table 2D-2 should be applied using engineering judgement.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Option is not adopted, as it is not needed as a result of the other changes adopted in this Section.</p>

Legibility distance has to be sufficient to give road users enough time to read and comprehend the sign. Under optimum conditions, a guide sign message can be read and understood in a brief glance. The legibility distance takes into account factors such as inattention, blocking of view by other vehicles, unfavorable weather, inferior eyesight, or other causes for delayed or slow reading. Where conditions permit, repetition of guide information on successive signs gives the road user more than one opportunity to obtain the information needed.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section2D08">Section 2D.08 Arrows</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>158. In Section 2D.08 Arrows, FHWA proposes to designate “curved-stem arrows” as “Type E directional arrows” and that they be associated exclusively with circular intersections. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency in terminology throughout the Manual. In concert with this change, FHWA proposes several revisions within this section to reflect this terminology and to provide additional flexibility for agencies to represent intended driver paths on guide signs for circular intersections.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">“Type E directional arrows” are adopted to replace “curved-stem arrows” used exclusively for circular intersections as proposed. Although a commenter suggested that use of these arrows be allowed for innovative intersections, such as jug handles, J- Turns, or Median U-Turns, use of these arrows for such signs is outside the scope of this rulemaking.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In the 4th paragraph of the 2nd Option statement, a sentence is added in the final rule indicating that a Type D arrow may be used on a on Street Name Sign (D3-1 Only) displaying two street names to indicate the direction of travel for each street. In concert with this, a Guidance statement is added in Section 2D.45 that pictographs should not be used when an arrow is used as the sign becomes visually complex and can inhibit processing of the information by an observer.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A Standard statement is added, which clarifies additional flexibility regarding the angle of the shaft for a Type C advance turn directional arrow and supports an existing Guidance statement which recommends arrows be pointed at the appropriate angle to clearly convey the direction to be taken. The new Standard requires the shaft to be bent at either a 90-degree angle or an oblique angle if a Type C arrow is used.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The 2nd paragraph of the 3rd Guidance statement is changed to Support and edited for consistency with Sections 2D.37, 2E.41 and 2D.39 which contain the applicable provisions for arrows used on Overhead Arrow-per Lane signs, Diagrammatic Advance guide signing, and Destination signs on the approaches to circular intersections.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>160. In Section 2D.11 Design of Route Signs, FHWA proposes to revise the first Standard paragraph to clarify the requirement that Interstate Route, Off- Interstate Business Route, U.S. Route, State Route, County Route, and Forest Route sign legends are required to comply with existing requirements in Chapter 2A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The first Standard paragraph that clarifies the requirement for sign legends to comply with the Standard Highway Signs publication is adopted.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In the final rule, existing text is deleted in the second paragraph of the first and second Standard statements related to the color of the Interstate route shield and Off-Interstate Business Route to be consistent with the removal of such information in other areas of the MUTCD. The standard colors are still applicable and are included in the Standard Highway Signs publication.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Standard paragraph regarding County Route sign dimensions to require a minimum size of 24 x 24 inches for consistency with the minimum sizes for other Route signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Standard for County Route sign dimensions is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Option paragraph 4 to designate the existing optional sign (Interstate Route sign that includes the State name) as M1-1a and to allow the optional use of this sign in place of the M1-1 sign when the Interstate Route sign is used in a Route Sign assembly.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Option paragraph 4 is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes a new Standard statement limiting the use of the M1-1a sign to Route Sign assemblies to clarify that the allowable optional use does not extend to other types of signs, such as when the Interstate Route sign is used within a guide sign, to limit the informational load imposed on the road user and because the relative scale of the State name to other legend elements displayed on the guide sign would be considerably smaller.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Standard limiting the use of the M1-1a sign to Route Sign assemblies is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the Option P7 and P16 statements regarding Route Signs used on a green guide sign that allow for the use of a white or yellow background to improve contrast, because FHWA has revised the design of the Off-Interstate Business Route and County Route signs to include a wider border to address contrast.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option paragraphs are deleted and new designs for Off-Interstate Business Route and County Route signs are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement to reiterate the existing requirement of the legend on State Route signs to conform to Standard Alphabets, for consistency. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement in Chapter 2A. FHWA proposes to amend the subsequent Guidance paragraph to limit the use of complex graphics to maintain consistency.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Standard to reiterate the existing requirement that the legend on State Route signs conform to Standard Alphabets contained in the “Standard Highway Signs” publication is adopted as proposed; however, this new statement does not change the existing requirement in Chapter 2A. The Guidance to restrict the use of complex graphics on State Route signs is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Standard paragraph regarding Route Signs for parks and forest roads to clarify the existing requirement to comply with the existing provisions of Chapter 2A, and to clarify that the provisions for the design of park and forest Route signs apply to non-National Forest routes.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>164. In Section 2D.29 Route Sign Assemblies, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance paragraph and new figure recommending that when more than four Route signs are needed in a single Advance Route Turn or Directional assembly, the Route signs should be mounted in a Guide sign. FHWA proposes this guidance as this would reduce the significant informational load on the road user of such assemblies by reducing the repetition of the cardinal direction and directional arrows.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A new Guidance paragraph in Section 2D.29 and corresponding new figure are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes an Option paragraph allowing Route Signs to be omitted for routes that are part of an agency’s internal numbering system, such as for maintenance or other purposes, and are not publicly mapped or intended to be used for navigational purposes by the general public. FHWA proposes this Option to allow agencies flexibility as to whether to post signs in certain areas.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">This new section is adopted in the final rule with edits to the Support statement to clarify the types of locations that may be considered complex.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">To address comments requesting additional detail on Overhead Arrow-Per-Lane signs for conventional roads, new Standard, Guidance, and Option statements are added in the final rule, consistent with the requirements and guidance on use of these signs found in Chapter 2E. As part of these changes, proposed Option statements are deleted about use of these signs on conventional roads where the designated lane is not a mandatory movement lane and for lane assignments for turns that do not include an option lane, because they are unnecessary.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A new table is added providing the minimum arrow heights for straight and curved arrows used on Overhead Arrow-Per-Lane signs for conventional roads based on recent research, entitled <i>Evaluation of Additional Alternatives of Arrow Sizes for Overhead Arrow-per-Lane (OAPL) Guide Signs</i>, FHWA Publication FHWA-HRT-23-036, for freeway arrow heights and then applying the appropriate proportion of letter height to arrow height for lower speeds on conventional roads.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The last Guidance statement is revised to clarify that when letter heights and other sign legend elements are enlarged there should be a corresponding increase in the arrow size used.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>172. In Section 2D.45 (existing Section 2D.43), retitled, “Street Name Signs (D3-1, D3-1a),” FHWA proposes to add a Guidance paragraph regarding the use of Street Name signs at intersections of freeway exit ramps with crossroads to help minimize the potential for wrong-way movements onto the freeway ramp.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph recommending Street Name signs should not be used at intersections of freeway exit ramps with crossroads is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Guidance regarding the engineering considerations that should be used to determine the letter heights used on Street Name signs at specific locations.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph regarding engineering considerations that should be used to determine letter heights on Street Name signs is adopted in the final rule. In response to comments, the text regarding lettering height is deleted and instead users are referred to Table 2D-6 for lettering heights to be used on street name signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Support paragraph regarding minimum letter heights to clarify that the minimum letter heights apply to the roadway that each sign faces, rather than to the street that has its name displayed on the Street Name sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A revised Support paragraph regarding minimum letter heights on Street name signs is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option paragraph to allow different letter heights in a sign assembly based on the speed limit in order to clarify that agencies may use different letter heights on different signs at the same intersection.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option paragraph allowing different letter heights in a sign assembly based on speed limit is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise existing Option in P9 to clarify that the letter height of the street name descriptor, the directional legend, or any other supplemental legend on the D3-1 and D3-1a signs may be smaller than that of the street name itself, while maintaining the letter size proportions between the street name and supplemental information on the sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A revised Option in renumbered P12 clarifying that information on the D3-1 and D3-1a signs may be smaller than that of the street name itself is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this Option, FHWA proposes to add Guidance that smaller letter legend should be at least two thirds of the letter height of the street name itself, but not less than 3 inches for the initial upper-case letters and not less than 2.25 inches for the lower-case letters for adequate legibility.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph on smaller letter heights for the street name descriptor, the directional legend, or any other supplemental legend on the D3-1 and D3-1a signs is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to change the remainder of the first sentence and the second sentence in existing Option in P9 regarding the use of conventional abbreviations for all information on the Street Name sign other than the street name itself to Guidance, and to provide a new table of acceptable street name descriptors and a table of street name descriptors that should not be used. FHWA proposes these changes to provide consistency with guide signs and to encourage the use of conventional abbreviations to reduce the size of the sign and for more rapid recognition.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change from an Option to Guidance statement regarding the use of conventional abbreviations on the Street Name sign to provide consistency with guide signs is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement regarding the proportional letter height of a supplemental legend to be consistent with guide signs and the letter heights that are used.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Guidance statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Option and Guidance statements allowing the use of block or house numbers as a supplemental legend on Street Name signs and recommending the application of house numbers for the left and right blocks of the cross street.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option and Guidance statements for the use of block or house numbers as a supplemental legend on Street Name signs are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed revision to existing P10 is adopted with clarifying revisions.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, a Guidance paragraph is added in the final rule recommending that pictographs not be used on street name signs with directional arrows, as the sign becomes visually complex and can inhibit processing of the information by an observer.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete a sentence in existing P14 regarding requirements for sign color and retroreflectivity because allowable colors for the legend and border are already included in existing P18 of this section and requirements for retroreflectivity are covered in existing Section 2A.07.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion of a sentence in existing P14 regarding requirements for sign color and retroreflectivity is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement regarding the omission of the border on a post-mounted Street Name sign to clarify that the decision to omit the border should be based on factors related to providing for adequate recognition of the sign by road users.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement regarding the omission of the border on a post-mounted Street Name sign is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement that recommends that Street Name signs display the street name on both sides of the sign to facilitate navigation for pedestrians.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement regarding the display of street names on Street Name signs is adopted with a minor editorial change.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Option regarding the use of arrows where the same road has two different street names. Additional information has been added to clarify that this option is not allowed where arrows would point in a movement direction that is not allowed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Option statement regarding the use of arrows where the same road has different street names is adopted with minor edits in the final rule.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance paragraph regarding streets or segments thereof that have been memorialized or dedicated. Second Street Name signs should not be used to display the memorial or dedication name. Memorial or Dedication signs should be located to minimize conspicuity the potential for confusion by road users.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement regarding streets or segments thereof that have been memorialized or dedicated signs is adopted with a minor editorial change.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add a Support statement referring users to Section 2H for information on the identification of streets at overcrossings and undercrossings.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support statement referring the reader to Section
2H.10 is adopted as proposed.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>176. In Section 2D.51 (existing Section 2D.49), WEIGH STATION Signing (D8 Series), FHWA proposes to add a Support paragraph that defines the areas where certain vehicles might be directed to stop to be weighed or inspected and that such an area can be permanent or a temporary mobile facility. FHWA adds this provision to give agencies more flexibility.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support statement is adopted with minor edits.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise existing Standard P2, and reference the figure, to indicate the appropriate sequence of signs for Weigh Station signing on a conventional highway and revises the sign terminology to match the typical sequence of other types of guide signs. The resulting sign sequence includes Advance Weigh Station Distance, Weigh Station Next Right, and Weigh Station Exit Direction Signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement is adopted with minor edits in the names of the three signs.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending an Exit Gore sign with the same basic legend as the Weigh Station Exit Direction sign be used to emphasize the entrance to the weigh station. FHWA proposes these revisions to provide more clarity on Weigh Station signing.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted as proposed but with minor changes in the names of the signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option statement that allows the use of the alternate legend COMMERCIAL VEHICLE INSPECTION AREA for the D8 series Weigh Station signs. FHWA proposes this revision to be consistent with the type of activity being conducted at the station.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted with a minor edit to the sign legend deleting the word AREA to reduce the amount of legend and maintain a reasonable sign size.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement indicating when the WEIGH STATION legend of the D8 series signs is replaced with the COMMERCIAL VEHICLE INSPECTION AREA legend, the WEIGH STATION legend of the R13–1 sign shall be replaced with the alternate legend INSPECTION area. FHWA proposes this change for consistency in sign legends.</p>

	<p>178. In Section 2D.53 (existing Section 2D.51), retitled,
“Truck and Passing Lane Signs (D17–1, D17–2, D17–3, and D17–4),” FHWA proposes to revise the existing Guidance statement to remove the word “NEXT” from a Truck Lane sign used immediately in advance of a truck lane in order to reserve the use of the word “NEXT” for areas where there is a series of extra lanes added along a highway for trucks to use, as proposed in the new Guidance statement.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is not adopted, as it is unnecessary.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to recommend that the sign include a distance of 1⁄2 mile in the legend. As part of these changes, FHWA clarifies that a truck lane is a lane added to the right of the travel lane to be used by trucks and other slow- moving vehicles. This allows the faster vehicles to pass without leaving the travel lane.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Guidance statement denoting a 1/2 mile truck passing lane distance in the legend on the sign is not adopted, as it would be unnecessarily restrictive. The first Guidance paragraph is revised to refer to a truck lane added on the right.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Guidance statements describing the use of Passing Lane and Next Passing Lane signs in a similar manner as Truck Lane signs. As part of these changes, FHWA distinguishes that a passing lane is an added lane to the left of the travel lane to be used by vehicle passing those in the travel lane.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the existing Option allowing alternate legends, because provisions for the use of Passing Lane signs are proposed in the new Guidance. In addition, because a climbing lane is simply another name for a truck lane, FHWA proposes to remove this option to improve on uniformity in signing.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Support statement to include a new figure that illustrates an example of signing for an intermittent passing lane. FHWA proposes to add this information to provide practitioners with needed guidance on the use of these signs, and their respective locations.</p>

	<p>180. In Section 2D.55 (existing Section 2D.50) Community Wayfinding Signs, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance paragraph recommending the evaluation of the entire existing system of signs for serviceability and general conformance with the Manual when a community wayfinding guide sign system is being considered.

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement regarding how the characters on a sign should be composed of the Standard Alphabet in accordance with Chapter 2A is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>182. In Section 2D.57 (existing Section 2D.55), retitled,
“National Scenic Byways Sign and Plaque (D6-4, D6-
4aP),” FHWA proposes a new Support statement to indicate that direction along routes and to sites is related to touring maps rather than directional signing and route marking of the byway itself.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new title for renumbered Section 2D.57 is adopted but the proposed Support paragraph is deleted from the final rule in response to comments.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add four Guidance paragraphs regarding the placement of signs displaying the name of the byway and associated byway Directional Assemblies. FHWA proposes these guidance statements to encourage uniformity and to separate Route Directional Assemblies from byway Directional Assemblies.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraphs regarding the placement of byway signs and Directional Assemblies are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard that prohibits the use of the Byway sign or plaque as part of a guide sign assembly, as these signs are intended only for use in independent Directional Assemblies. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement, consistent with the existing Standard requiring that other signs have primary visibility.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>183. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2D.58 State-Designated Scenic Byway, Historic Trail, and Auto Tour Route Signs,” that contains relocated provisions from existing Section 2H.07, Auto Tour Routes, as well as new provisions for State scenic byway and historic trails. FHWA proposes this new Section to address inconsistencies in how these facilities are signed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Section 2D.58 that contains relocated provisions from existing Section 2H.07 is adopted with minor edits. The first Standard in the final rule is revised to more clearly indicate that Scenic byway, historic trail and auto tours route signs designs shall not have a similar design to or resemble a highway route sign. This change is made to avoid confusion with officially numbered roues on a highway system that are marked by the official route sign.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, additional Option provisions are added which include applicable sign names and standard sign designations to correspond with the signs proposed in Figure 2D-35.</p>
