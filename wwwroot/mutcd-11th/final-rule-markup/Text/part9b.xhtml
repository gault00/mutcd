    <h1>Chapter 9B. <span class="text_added">Regulatory </span>Signs</h1>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>586. FHWA proposes to separate existing Chapter 9B Signs into three chapters—retitle Chapter 9B to “Regulatory Signs,” add a new Chapter 9C “Warning Signs and Object Markers,” and add a new Chapter 9D “Guide and Service Signs.”</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Existing Chapter 9B is separated into three new chapters and adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to separate Table 9B–1 Bicycle Facility Sign and Plaque Minimum Sizes into three tables—Table 9B–1 for regulatory signs, Table 9C–1 for warning signs and object markers, and Table 9D–1 for guide and service signs. These changes are for consistency with how signs are organized in Part 2 and to make it easier to locate bicycle related signs by sign type.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The three proposed tables are consolidated into a single table and adopted as Table 9B-1.</p>

	<p>587. In Section 9B.01 (existing Section 9B.03) STOP and YIELD Signs (R1–1, R1–2), FHWA proposes adding a Standard that prohibits a STOP sign or a YIELD sign from being installed in conjunction with a bicycle signal face. FHWA proposes this restriction to provide uniformity in the application of signals and to avoid conflicts between bicycle signal indications and signs.</p>

	<p>589. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9B.03 Advance Intersection Lane Control Signs for Bicycle Lanes (R3–8 Series)” to provide Standard, Guidance, Option, and Support statements for accommodating bicycle lanes on the R3–8 series of signing where determined to be appropriate. FHWA proposes this new section because improper dissemination of this information can result in unwieldy sign designs or legends. The amount of information that can be legibly displayed and comprehended by road users on signs or in signing sequence on the same approach to an intersection is limited. The number and combination of permissible movements by both the motor vehicle and the bicycle may be numerous, thereby complicating the cognitive task of the road user at a decision point.</p>

	<p>590. In Section 9B.04, retitled, “Bike Lane Signs and Plaques (R3–17, R3–17aP, R3–5hP),” FHWA proposes changing a portion of the existing Guidance regarding the placement of Bike Lane signs and plaques periodically along the bicycle lane to an Option in order to give agencies the discretion of sign placement when developing a policy for the use of Bike Lane signs. As part of this change, FHWA also proposes to allow the use of other regulatory plaques such as BEGIN (M4–14) and END (M4–6) with Bike Lane signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes adding Option statements allowing the use of a BIKE LANE plaque to supplement Mandatory Movement Lane Control signs in places where only a single bicycle movement is permitted from the bicycle lane and to supplement Optional Movement Lane Control signs where two or more movements from a bicycle lane are permitted in order to prevent operational problems.

	<h3 id="section9B18">Section 9B.18 Two-Stage Bicycle Turn Box Regulatory Signing (R9-23 Series)</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>599. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9B.18 Two-Stage Bicycle Turn Box Regulatory Signing (R9–23 series).”</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes Standard, Option, and Support for the new sign as well as a new Figure 9B–5 that illustrates required signing for two-stage turn boxes that are used to simplify the turning task for bicyclists at certain intersections.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>The FHWA proposed to add a new Section in Chapter 9B on regulatory signing for Two-Stage Bicycle Turn Boxes that includes Support, Standard, and Options. The Standards defined conditions for which a two-stage turn box shall be provided and corresponding regulatory signs necessary to convey that information. The Option allowed for an appropriately sized Street Name sign to be installed with the All Turns From Bike Lane sign to identify the cross street where the turn box will be available.</p>

	<p>Commenters suggested the proposed Standard defining specific conditions when a two-stage bicycle turn box is required be changed to Option and those conditions be modified to provide further clarity. Commenters also requested that the Standards requiring specific regulatory signs be used when bicyclists are being legally required to use a two-stage bicycle turn box be changed to Guidance. Similarly, commenters recommended the Standards requiring the mounting location of these regulatory signs also be changed to Guidance. Based on these comments and further review, FHWA changes the Standard that defined specific conditions when a two-stage bicycle turn box would be required to a Support statement that simply describes certain situations where a two-stage bicycle turn box can be used to facilitate bicycle turning movements. In alignment with this change, FHWA provides clarifying modifications to the description of those situations.</p>

	<p>The FHWA retains the Standards requiring specific regulatory signs be used when bicyclists are required to use a two-stage bicycle turn box and the Standards requiring the appropriate mounting location of these signs. The FHWA retains these Standards to ensure bicyclists have this necessary regulatory information on the jurisdictional prescribed use of the bicycle turn box. These Standards will help ensure the safety of bicyclists and reduce conflicts between bicyclists and other traffic.</p>

	<p>Also, to address a vehicle movement conflict that could compromise the safety of bicyclists, FHWA adds new Guidance that two-stage bicycle turn boxes should be located outside of the path of right-turning vehicle traffic, and where a turn box is located within the path of right-turning vehicle traffic, a NO TURN ON RED (R10-11) sign should be used.</p>

	<p>The FHWA believes these provisions will help strengthen the protection of vulnerable users consistent with Section 11135 of BIL.</p>

	<p>603. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 9B.22 Bicycle SIGNAL Signs (R10–
40, R10–40a, R10–41, R10–41a, R10–41b).” FHWA
proposes this new section in concert with the addition of bicycle signal faces in the MUTCD. The proposed Standard in this section requires that a Bicycle Signal
sign be installed immediately adjacent to every
bicycle signal face to inform road users that the specialized signal control face is intended only for bicyclists. FHWA proposes this new section to be consistent with past FHWA action and proposed changes to Part 4 to establish uniform signal control indications for bicycles on a national basis, which would improve bicyclist safety, especially at locations where separate signal phases are provided for motor vehicle and bicycle traffic.

	<p>548. FHWA proposes to relocate existing Section 8B.17 LOOK Sign (R15–8) to Section 9B.21 to allow the use of a LOOK sign on a shared-use path or separated bikeway at a grade crossing. FHWA proposes this change because these signs are no longer to be installed to communicate with drivers, as the YIELD or STOP sign on the Crossbuck Assemblies at passive crossings imply that motorists should look for rail traffic. An Option was also added in Section 8E.03 for using LOOK signs for pathways and sidewalks.
