	<p>419. In Section 4I.01 (existing Section 4E.01) Pedestrian Signal Heads, FHWA proposes to modify P2 to align better with the recommendation for an engineering study with specific factors for consideration as outlined in Section 4K.01.</p>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>In Section 4I.01 (existing Section 4E.01) Pedestrian Signal Heads, FHWA proposed in the NPA to modify Paragraph 2 to better align with the recommendation for an engineering study with specific factors for consideration as outlined in Section 4K.01.</p>
	
	<p>The intent of the proposed NPA text was misinterpreted by many reviewers. There were many comments pointing out that an engineering study should not be required before installing APS. Many commenters suggested APS should be installed at all traffic control signals and PHBs where pedestrian signal heads are used, and that agencies should not have to justify the need for APS by conducting an engineering study based on the factors listed in Section 4K.01.</p>

	<p>Upon consideration of all comments received, FHWA is removing all text from the MUTCD discussing when APS “should” be considered or provided. The decision of when to use APS is subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. Notably, since the 2009 edition of the MUTCD, multiple courts have recognized that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require jurisdictions to make their pedestrian signals accessible.

Cnty. of Nassau,

No. 10 CV 4208 DRH AKT, 2014 WL 2454639, at *12 (E.D.N.Y. June 2, 2014). As with other sections of the MUTCD that address certain accessibility issues, FHWA refers users to the applicable ADA and Rehabilitation Act requirements and limits discussion of APS to technical specifications. The MUTCD does, however, include language in Support statements with information about the importance of APS in general and, in particular, at certain kinds of crossings.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>424. In Section 4I.06 (existing Section 4E.06) Pedestrian Intervals and Signal Phases, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard requiring the display of a flashing red signal indication when the pedestrian signal heads at a pedestrian hybrid beacon are displaying a flashing Upraised Hand signal indication. FHWA proposes this change to be consistent with the specified operation of pedestrian hybrid beacons in new Section 4J.03 (existing Section 4F.03).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments received that noted that the proposed Standard was redundant with provisions in Section 4J.03, the proposed change is not adopted.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise existing P4 to reduce the minimum buffer interval from 3 seconds to 2 seconds. FHWA proposes this change based on the results of an official experiment that was performed by the Delaware DOT (http://sites.udel.edu/dct/files/
2013/10/Rpt.-211-Pedestrian-Signals-2d65hei.pdf). The experiment concluded there was no statistically significant difference from a safety perspective when the minimum buffer interval was reduced from 3 seconds to 2 seconds. FHWA proposes this change to provide additional flexibility to agencies in optimizing the timing of traffic signals.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to revise existing P7 to recommend calculating pedestrian clearance time based on crossing distance measured from the edge of the pavement and not from the shoulder or edge of the traveled way. FHWA proposes this change because pedestrians who are waiting for a walk indication typically do not feel safe waiting on a paved shoulder and instead wait at the edge of the pavement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a Standard requiring the minimum required time for the Walk interval be displayed in addition to the time provided for the leading pedestrian interval at locations where leading pedestrian intervals are being utilized without accessible pedestrian signals. FHWA proposes this change to align with accessible pedestrian signal guidance throughout Part 4.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments received that noted this proposed requirement may discourage the use of pedestrian leading intervals, the proposed change is adopted but reduced to Guidance to provide agencies more flexibility. Clarification is also made that the WALKING PERSON indication should be the time provided for the leading pedestrian interval plus 7 seconds.</p>
