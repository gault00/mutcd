	<div class="npa">
	<p>540. In Section 8B.02 Sizes of Grade Crossing Signs, FHWA proposes to clarify that the sizes shown in Table 8B–1 are minimum sizes. FHWA also proposes to change the minimum required size of a Yield sign at multilane conventional road grade crossings from 48″× 48″ to 36″× 36.″ FHWA proposes this change to provide clarity regarding the requirements of the sign size and based on Official Ruling No. 8(09)–7(I) (<a href ="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_7.htm">http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_7.htm</a>).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Section is adopted as proposed.</p>

    <h3 id="section8B03">Section 8B.03 Grade Crossing (Crossbuck) Sign (R15-1) and Number of Tracks Plaque (R15-2P) at Active and Passive Grade Crossings</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>541. In Section 8B.03 Grade Crossing (Crossbuck) Sign (R15–1) and Number of Tracks Plaque (R15–2P) at Active and Passive Grade Crossings, FHWA proposes to upgrade an existing Option to a Standard to require a minimum of one Crossbuck sign on each highway approach to a gated highway-LRT grade crossing on a semi-exclusive alignment. FHWA proposes this change to make sure that road users understand why a gate is present.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement, and the Option statement that follows it, are adopted with editorial changes to clarify where Crossbuck signs are required at highway-LRT grade crossings.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise existing Paragraph 5 to require the Number of Tracks plaque below the Crossbuck sign where there are two or more tracks at a grade crossing, regardless of the presence of automatic gates. This revision is necessary because the presence of two or more tracks at a crossing adds complexity for road users and additional risks, such as in situations in which trains occupy both tracks, where the tracks are spaced such that a vehicle could become stuck between the tracks, or where the visibility of the second track is limited. This revision would improve safety by providing uniformity for multitrack crossings that would accommodate the expectancy of the road user.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise existing Paragraph 7 to reduce the requirement for retroreflective white material on the back of the Crossbuck sign to apply only to passive grade crossings. FHWA proposes this change because active grade crossings have signals or warning lights for traffic control device conspicuity.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard paragraph is adopted as proposed. A new Option statement regarding the use of retroreflective white material on the back of Crossbuck signs at active grade crossings is added in response to comments because the white retroreflective material may improve visibility of the grade crossing during power outages.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standard paragraphs regarding minimum lateral clearance between the edge of the Crossbuck sign and the face of a vertical curb, edge of traveled way, and/or edge of paved or surfaced shoulder. FHWA proposes this change to be consistent with the dimensions shown in Figure 8B–3 for Crossbuck Assemblies and to be consistent with Paragraphs 6, 7, and 8 of existing Section 8C.01.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Standard paragraphs regarding minimum lateral clearance are not adopted, as they are unneeded since the topic is covered in Chapter 2A.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance statement is revised to refer to the standards of the railroad company, transit agency and regulatory agency with statutory authority to be consistent with the Standard statement in Section 8D.01 regarding clearance between traffic control devices and the nearest rail.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance statement recommending the Crossbuck sign to be at least 12 feet from the center of the nearest track. FHWA proposes this change to formalize the dimensions shown on Figure 8D–2.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance and Option statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance paragraph recommending the mounting height to the center of Crossbuck signs to be approximately 9 feet and an Option to adjust the height based on local conditions and to accommodate signs below the Crossbuck sign. FHWA proposes this change to clarify the dimension shown on Figure 8B–2.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">FHWA adopts editorial revisions to Figures 8B-2 and 8B-3 to correctly show the mounting height measurements consistent with the text in Section 8B.03.

    <h3 id="section8B04">Section 8B.04 Crossbuck Assemblies with YIELD or STOP Signs at Passive Grade Crossings</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>542. In Section 8B.04 Crossbuck Assemblies with YIELD or STOP Signs at Passive Grade Crossings, FHWA proposes a new Guidance paragraph recommending the use of a STOP sign at the Crossbuck Assembly where a passive grade crossing is located at the stem of a T-intersection with inadequate clear storage area between the tracks and the parallel roadway. FHWA also proposes that if a STOP sign is installed, consideration should also be given to installing a YIELD sign at the highway intersection. FHWA proposes this new text to provide practitioners with additional information for crossings with this geometry.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph is adopted with editorial changes made in response to comments to refer to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Sections 8A.03 and 8A05, and to provide flexibility to the agencies and Diagnostic Team to determine the appropriate traffic control devices for each location.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard paragraph requiring a Yield sign and TO TRAINS (R15–9P) supplemental plaque when Crossbuck Assemblies are used within the limits of a highway-highway intersection controlled by a traffic control signal not interconnected with the grade crossing and not preempted by the approach of rail traffic.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard paragraph is adopted with editorial changes to refer to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Sections 8A.03 and 8A.05, and to provide flexibility to the agencies and Diagnostic Team to determine the appropriate traffic control devices for each location.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to prohibit the use of a Stop sign with the Crossbuck Assembly in this situation. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with Section 4A.08 (existing Section 4D.34) regarding the use of stop signs with traffic control signals.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise existing Paragraph 10 regarding YIELD and STOP sign mounting heights on Crossbuck Assemblies to require at least 5 feet in rural areas and at least 7 feet in areas where parking or pedestrian movements are likely to occur. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency throughout the Manual regarding vertical mounting height.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the existing Guidance paragraph regarding a Crossbuck Assembly on a separate support than the Crossbuck sign, to clarify the recommended location of YIELD or STOP sign in relationship to the Crossbuck sign and to clarify the lateral clearances from a curb or edge of traveled way. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency throughout the Manual regarding lateral offset.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed revision to this Guidance paragraph regarding location of the YIELD or STOP sign in relation to the Crossbuck sign is adopted. The proposed revision to clarify lateral clearances is not adopted, as it is unneeded because this is covered in Chapter 2A.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the existing Standards regarding the vertical strip of retroreflective white material on a Crossbuck support to clarify that a white retroreflective strip wrapped around a round support satisfies the requirement as long at the round support has an outside diameter of at least 2 inches. FHWA proposes this change to provide clarity regarding the requirements of the white retroreflective strip and based on Official Ruling No. 8(09)–1(I) (<a href ="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_001.htm">http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_001.htm</a>).</p>

	<p>547. FHWA proposes new Option and Support statements in Section 8B.16 (existing Section 8B.23) to address warning, selective exclusion, and detour signing for additional vehicle types and combinations that may encounter hang-up situations at low ground clearance crossings. The proposed changes are in response to NTSB recommendation H–18–24 (<a href ="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=H-18-024">https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx?Rec=H-18-024</a>).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>The NPA included a compliance date of 5 years for the new Guidance in Section 8B.16 recommending the installation of Low Ground Clearance and/or Vehicle Exclusion and detour signs for vehicles with low ground clearances that might become immobilized or hung up on high-profile grade crossings due to their undercarriages being too low to clear the roadway profile at the track crossing. The proposed compliance date applied only to those locations with known histories of vehicle hang-ups occurring, because sufficient geometric criteria do not currently exist for agencies to evaluate crossings to determine the specific types of vehicles that could experience hang-up situations. Comments on this section acknowledged the value of detour signing for low clearance vehicles in certain cases but suggested there are too many variables in terms of geometric conditions and the types of vehicles and vehicle combinations to adequately identify the risk of these vehicles hanging up at a grade crossing. There were also comments that suggested signing for all vehicles that could potentially hang up at crossings would result in excessive signing and driver confusion. There were also comments about the proposed compliance date, suggesting instead that devices should be brought into compliance through routine maintenance operations. Despite the challenges, FHWA acknowledges the need, as recommended in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation H-18-024, to provide guidance to agencies to help identify and address high-profile crossings, especially those that are known from past experience to be subject to specific vehicle type hang-ups. The text provides Guidance and Support to assist agencies in addressing these situations through signing. The compliance date applies to known potential vehicle hang-up locations that are currently identified by agencies through their grade crossing inventory. The FHWA adopts the Guidance and Support statements as proposed, including compliance dates.</p>

	<p>552. In Section 8B.26 (existing Section 8B.18) Emergency Notification System Sign (I–13), FHWA proposes changing P1 from Guidance to Standard to require installing Emergency Notification signs for all highway-rail grade crossings and all highway-LRT grade crossings on semi-exclusive alignments. FHWA proposes this change to be consistent with regulations promulgated by the FRA (49 CFR 234.311).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is renumbered to Section 8B.27. The Standard is adopted with editorial revisions in response to comments to clarify when the ENS signs are required at highway-LRT grade crossings.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard paragraph requiring minimum width and height dimensions, as well as number and letter heights for the Emergency Notification sign to be consistent with new requirements promulgated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FHWA also proposes changing the provision for the sign to be retroreflective from Guidance to a Standard to be consistent with requirements promulgated by the FRA (49 CFR 234.309).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes an Option statement allowing the seven-character grade crossing inventory number to be shown on the sign as a black legend on a white rectangular background. FHWA proposes this change to allow additional flexibility.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance statement recommending Emergency Notification signs be attached to the Crossbuck Assemblies or grade crossing signal masts on the right-hand side of each roadway approach to the grade crossing. FHWA proposes this recommendation to provide uniformity in sign placement.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted with revisions to recommend either parallel or perpendicular sign orientation. The revision is made in response to FRA comments. An additional Guidance statement is added to clarify that the sign should be visible when automatic gates are in the vertical or horizontal position.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes an Option statement to allow Emergency Notification signs to be located on a separate post and permitting additional Emergency Notification signs to be installed at a grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statement is adopted as proposed. An Option statement is added to permit larger Emergency Notification System signs for improved visibility.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A new Option statement is added to allow the use of a NOTICE header panel on the Emergency Notification System sign to increase conspicuity. FHWA adopts the change based on comment as a specific exception to Section 2A.15 which allows the use of the NOTICE header panel only for regulatory, warning, and guide signs.</p>
