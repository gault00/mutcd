	<span class="text_added"><h3 id="section3D06">Section 3D.06 Arrow Pavement Markings for Roundabouts</h3></span>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>358. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3D.06 Arrow Pavement Markings for Roundabouts” containing revisions to P1 and P4–P6 from existing Section 3C.06. FHWA proposes new Guidance paragraphs to recommend not using lane- use arrows on single-lane approaches to circular intersections.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3D.06 Arrow Pavement Markings for Roundabouts is adopted with changes as discussed herein.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Guidance for two-lane approaches to circular intersections and for approaches with dual left or dual right turns. FHWA proposes these changes to improve consistency in the application of lane use arrows at circular intersections based on an NCHRP study (<a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_672.pdf">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_672.pdf</a>).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, guidance regarding two- lane approaches is not adopted as proposed, and instead relies on the information contained in Section 3B.23. Guidance for approaches with double left or right turns is adopted with a change in terminology from “dual” to “double.”.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard paragraph prohibiting lane-use arrow pavement markings between a crosswalk and wide dotted line(s) entering the circular roadway. FHWA proposes this change because road users need adequate advance notification of the permitted movements within each lane and this area of the approach is often obscured by stopped vehicles.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to change the Option P6 to Guidance to recommend, rather than just allow, lane use arrows on the roundabout approaches to match the type of arrows (normal or elongated) used on the corresponding regulatory lane-use signs, to improve consistency between signing and markings for better driver comprehension.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance is adopted with minor editorial edits. FHWA proposed to change fish-hook to elongated in describing the optional arrow designs for use approaching roundabouts. FHWA instead adopts the term curved-stem arrow, as it is more descriptive of the design, and is consistent with other Parts of the
Manual.
