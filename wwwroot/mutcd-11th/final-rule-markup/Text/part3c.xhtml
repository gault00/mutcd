	<p>346. In Section 3C.01 (existing Section 3B.18), retitled, “General,” FHWA proposes to change a Support statement to a Standard paragraph requiring crosswalk markings at non-intersection crossing locations to improve safety for pedestrians at locations where vehicles may not expect pedestrian crossings.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing of Support in Section 3C.01 to Standard is adopted with revision and moved to 3C.02 to provide additional context and clarification based on comments received. In addition, the existing Support statement is retained as it offers separate context.</p>

	<p>The previous Support required crosswalk markings to mark the crosswalk legally at non-intersection locations. FHWA proposes to revise this Support into a Standard to identify clearly the requirements of crosswalk markings at non-intersection locations.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard paragraph requiring that paving materials used to function as transverse lines to establish a marked crosswalk shall be white and retroreflective.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Standard is adopted, however as this standard is specific to the design of crosswalks and not general information it is relocated to new Section
3C.03.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes that the paving materials be required to use a white additive in the mixture to produce a white surface. FHWA proposes this change to improve target value and visibility of the crosswalk for pedestrian safety and to fulfill the retroreflectivity requirement for traffic control devices, when paving materials, instead of pavement markings, are used to define the marked crosswalk.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A new Support statement was also proposed to provide cross reference to proposed Section 3H.03 for provisions relating to aesthetic treatments for the interior portion of a legally established crosswalk. The Support statement is adopted as proposed, however as it relates to the design of a crosswalk and not general information it is relocated to new Section
3C.03.

	<h4>Marked Crosswalks</h4>
	<p>In the NPA, FHWA proposed to add a new Section 3C.02 Applications of Crosswalk Markings, containing several paragraphs from existing Section 3B.18. As part of this, FHWA proposed several revisions to clarify placement of crosswalks. A new Standard paragraph proposed in Section 3C.01 is adopted with revisions and located in Section 3C.02 in the final rule, since it includes requirements specific to the application of crosswalk markings. The Standard requires, after the agency or official having authority makes the determination to legally establish a crosswalk at a non-intersection location, that crosswalk markings shall be provided. The FHWA believes this is appropriate as it will improve safety, by clearly identifying the requirements of crosswalk markings at non-intersection locations which will help alert road users of a designated pedestrian crossing point and provide guidance for pedestrians by defining and delineating paths across roadways, particularly vulnerable road users, in conformance with Section 11135 of the BIL.</p>

	<p>In the NPA, FHWA retained some text unchanged from the 2009 MUTCD Section 3B.18, including the existing Guidance Paragraph 7 recommending crosswalk markings be installed where engineering judgment indicates they are needed to direct pedestrians to the proper crossing path(s) at locations controlled by traffic control signals or on approaches controlled by STOP or YIELD signs.</p>

	<p>Many commenters indicated that crosswalk markings should be required (rather than recommended) at all crosswalks regardless of location, and particularly at signalized intersections. In response to comments, FHWA revises propose Paragraph 5 (now Paragraph 1), to indicate crosswalk markings should be installed at locations controlled by traffic control signals and adds an Option (Paragraph 2) to allow the crosswalk to remain unmarked if engineering judgement indicates they are not needed to direct pedestrians to the proper crossing path(s).</p>

	<p>The FHWA believes that requiring all crosswalks to be marked in all locations would be a substantial change that would benefit from a review of relevant research to include stop lines, consideration of the impacts to signalized intersections in rural areas with no pedestrian facilities, consideration of the impacts to agencies with a significant number of intersections controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign, and additional public comment before being considered for adoption in the MUTCD as a Standard.</p>

	<p>Changes to existing Guidance Paragraph 8 are adopted in Section 3C.02 Paragraph 4, with revisions in response to comments, with the intent to remove language which may have been previously misinterpreted as simply discouraging or avoiding the installation of crosswalks. Although not new Guidance, due to the importance of vulnerable road user safety, it is vital to reiterate the existing recommendation to conduct an engineering study in order to determine whether providing a marked crosswalk alone is safe for locations not controlled by a traffic signal or STOP or YIELD sign, or if additional traffic control devices and other measures should be considered to reduce traffic speeds, shorten crossing distances, enhance the conspicuity of the crossing, or provide active warning of pedestrian presence, as further discussed in the revised existing Guidance Paragraph 9 (now Section 3C.03 Paragraph 6). The agency (or owner) having jurisdiction over the roadway is ultimately responsible for the decisions on what, and where, to build and the engineering study recommended aims to guide the recommended traffic control devices at the determined location.</p>

	<p>In the final rule, FHWA revises the criteria to be considered in the recommended engineering study. In addition to the distance from adjacent signalized intersections, the distance to other controlled crossings should be considered. The existing pedestrian volume and delay criteria were expanded to include bicyclists, projected volumes, paths of travel, the ages and abilities of road users, and the location or frequency of public transit stops to guide practitioners on additional factors to consider in determining where to mark crosswalks away from controlled locations. An important factor is roadway context; on roadways where adjacent land use suggests that trips could be served by varied modes, it is important to provide safe crossings. Including projected volumes in the recommended engineering study can address concerns that pedestrian and bicycle demand may not be captured by a traffic count, as locations without an established crosswalk might be avoided by some pedestrians and bicyclists. Once the appropriate traffic control devices are installed, consistent with the adopted Paragraph 6 discussed below, to establish a safe crosswalk, the volume of pedestrians and bicyclists may increase due to the new or improved crossing. The existing criterion of the geometry of the location was expanded to specify the horizontal and vertical geometry of the crossing location to highlight the importance of stopping sight distance and visibility of road users utilizing a crosswalk and the potential effect on vulnerable road user safety. Analysis of available gaps was also raised as a potential criterion for consideration in the recommended engineering study and FHWA believes this is included in pedestrian and bicyclist delays. The FHWA also received comments suggesting additional changes such as crash history and using pedestrian walking speeds in lieu of ages and abilities, specific warrants for crosswalks, or minimum spacing of crosswalks be included in the criteria of an engineering study. The FHWA believes crash history could be considered an “other appropriate factor” (item N) to be considered in the engineering study, but the other suggested changes from commenters would require further research before being considered in a future rulemaking effort.</p>

	<p>Changes to existing Guidance Paragraph 9 are adopted as Paragraph 6 in Section 3C.02, with editorial revisions in response to comments. In order to protect vulnerable road users, FHWA provides recommendations of specific conditions where the installation of additional traffic control devices, and other measures, instead of simply marking a new crosswalk with signs alone, should be considered, consistent with FHWA's Guide for Improving Safety at Uncontrolled Crossing Locations. The recommendation is intended to improve pedestrian safety at uncontrolled crossing locations with posted speed limits 40 mph or greater and at locations where there is a crash threat due to multiple lane crossings or limited sight distance by encouraging the installation of additional traffic control devices or other measures, as appropriate, beyond the basic marked crosswalks and warning signs. Some of these additional measures include other traffic control devices and applications designed to reduce traffic speeds, shorten crossing distances, enhance driver awareness of the crossing, and/or provide active warning of pedestrian presence.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>348. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3C.03 Design of Crosswalk Markings,” containing P4, P11, P12, and P17 of existing Section 3B.18. FHWA also proposes to add new Standard paragraphs requiring a minimum width of 6 feet for marked crosswalks and a minimum width of 8 feet for crosswalks at non-intersections and where the posted speed limit is 40 mph or greater. FHWA proposes this change to improve the visibility and recognition of pedestrian crosswalks.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3C.03 Design of Crosswalk Markings with information from existing Section 3B.18 and a new Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to modify Guidance P11 to recommend using high-visibility crosswalk markings at marked crosswalks at non-intersection locations to reduce pedestrian crash potential.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance P11 is modified as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA further proposes to reduce the second Guidance sentence in P11 to an Option regarding improving visibility by parking prohibitions on the approach to marked crosswalks.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, the proposal to change the Guidance regarding improving visibility by parking prohibitions on the approach to marked crosswalks to Option is not adopted because the parking prohibition is a safety benefit for vulnerable users of the crosswalk.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes changing P17 from a Guidance to Standard requiring, rather than recommending, crosswalk markings to be located so that the curb ramps are within the extension of the crosswalk markings, where curb ramps are provided. FHWA proposes this change to accommodate users with visual disabilities better.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposal to change the Guidance regarding curb ramps being located within the extension of the crosswalk markings to Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph recommending that transverse crosswalk markings extend the full width of the pavement or edge of intersecting crosswalk to discourage diagonal crossing between crosswalks.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance regarding transverse crosswalk markings is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA	proposes	these	changes	to	provide consistency in crosswalk applications.</p>

FHWA proposes this new section based on information contained in a research study (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/09060/09060.pdf">http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/09060/09060.pdf</a>) that found that pedestrian movements require special considerations to avoid violating driver expectancy or disorienting pedestrians.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3C.11 is adopted with changes in response to comments and titled, “Crosswalks at Diamond Interchanges with a Transposed-Alignment Crossroad.” In addition to the previous research referenced in the NPA, NCHRP Research Report 959 was published. In concert with the renaming of the section, additional support was added to describe the conditions and considerations at a diverging diamond interchange. The proposed Guidance was refined in order to provide more specific traffic control device recommendations.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Figure 3C–3 to illustrate locations of pedestrian crossings at diamond interchanges with a transposed alignment crossroad.</p>
