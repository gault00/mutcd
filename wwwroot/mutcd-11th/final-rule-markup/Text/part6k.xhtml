	<p>495. In Section 6K.01 (existing Section 6F.63) Channelizing Devices—General, FHWA proposes to add P10 and revise P12 to reflect changes associated with Official Ruling No. 6(09)–11(I) (<a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/6_09_11.htm">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/6_09_11.htm</a>).

	<p class="fr-disp">The change to the first Option statement in Paragraph 6 is not adopted, in response to comment. The changes to Paragraphs 10 and 12 are adopted as proposed.
</p>

	<p>Also, FHWA proposes to change existing P18 from a Standard to a Guidance statement because “significant amount” is not defined.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed change from Standard to Guidance for Paragraph 18 is not adopted. Instead, based on comment, the sentence is modified to eliminate "significant amount" and to replace it with "no longer serviceable", which is defined in Section 1C.02.</p>
