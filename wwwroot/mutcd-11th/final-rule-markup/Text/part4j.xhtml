	<p>In Section 4J.01 (Section 4F.01 of the 2009 MUTCD) Application of PHB, FHWA proposed to add a new Option to allow the reduction of the signal warrant criteria for pedestrian volume crossing the major street by as much as 50 percent if the 15th-percentile crossing speed of pedestrians is less than 3.5 feet per second. The FHWA proposed this change for consistency with traffic control signal Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume.</p>

	<p>The FHWA also proposed to add an Option to allow the separate application of the major-street traffic volumes criteria in each direction when there is a divided street having a median of sufficient width for pedestrians to wait in accordance with Official Ruling No. 4(09)–25 (I) and for consistency with the proposed change in Section 4C.05.</p>

	<p>While the NCUTCD and engineering organizations agreed with the proposed changes in the NPA for Section 4J.01, the majority of the comments were related to the current MUTCD text regarding the volume thresholds, where no revisions were proposed. General themes of the comments included: (1) Suggestions to add other warrants or factors such as distance to adjacent pedestrian crosswalks, crash experience, using FHWA's Guide for Improving Safety at Uncontrolled Crossing Locations surrounding land use and density, and using FHWA's Safe Transportation for Every Pedestrian (STEP) guidance, (2) Changes to the minimum thresholds in Figures 4J–1 and 4J–2, and (3) Adding Guidance that aims to make major streets safe to cross at regular intervals by establishing Guidance on the distance people can be expected to walk to get to a crosswalk.</p>

	<p>The FHWA retains the NPA language, including the existing vehicular and pedestrian volume threshold figures, based on the following considerations. The PHBs are addressed in the FHWA Proven Safety Countermeasure Initiative (FHWA–SA–21–045) as a safety strategy to address pedestrian crash risk. The PHB is an intermediate option between a flashing beacon and a full pedestrian signal because it assigns right-of-way and provides positive stop control. It also allows motorists to proceed once pedestrians have cleared their side of the travel lane(s), reducing vehicle delay and congestion, often in urban conditions where congestion can impact the quality of life of surrounding residents and business owners.</p>

	<p>In response to comments suggesting changes that were not proposed in the NPA, the existing vehicular and pedestrian thresholds were determined based on research and are substantially lower than the pedestrian volume warrants for a traffic control signal, primarily due to the trade-off in efficiency since vehicular traffic can move during the flashing red interval (concurrent with flashing Don't Walk) if the crosswalk is clear. Further, the NPA added new Options to provide more flexibility in justifying the installation of PHBs with a significant reduction in the threshold volumes based on lower walking speeds and the consideration of other factors that may support the installation of PHBs at locations where the thresholds are not met. These proposed Options are adopted in this Final Rule.</p>

	<p>An NCHRP study is underway that will review the existing volume thresholds and make recommendations on pedestrian warrants based on many scenarios for PHBs as well as traffic control signals and pedestrian actuated warning devices. This information will be used to consider revisions to vehicular and pedestrian volume thresholds in a future edition of the MUTCD.</p>

	<p>The FHWA believes the provisions, as adopted, further FHWA's statutory obligation under Section 11135 of BIL to provide for the protection of vulnerable road users by providing more flexibility for engineers to justify installation of PHBs.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>426. In Section 4J.02 (existing Section 4F.02) Design of Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons, FHWA proposes to add Item E in Standard P1 requiring a Stop sign for the minor-street approach when a pedestrian hybrid beacon is installed at or immediately adjacent to an intersection.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete existing items A and C of Guidance P4 regarding placement of pedestrian hybrid beacons with respect to side streets and driveways and the installation of signs and pavement markings. FHWA proposes these changes based on an FHWA evaluation study of field implementations (http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safet y/10042/10042.pdf) of pedestrian hybrid beacons installed at or near intersections, which found that there were no significant safety or operational problems with such locations.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending accessible pedestrian signals be installed in conjunction with a pedestrian hybrid beacon in response to Official Change Request
4(09)–42(C).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change the first sentence of Standard P8 to an Option, allowing the CROSSWALK STOP ON RED or STOP ON RED–PROCEED ON FLASHING RED WHEN CLEAR signs to be installed facing each major street approach to provide agencies flexibility on where to locate these signs. FHWA proposes these changes based on the field experience of agencies that have extensively used pedestrian hybrid beacons. The 2017 Traffic Control Devices Pooled Fund Study—”Comprehension and Legibility of Selected Symbol Signs Phase IV” (https://pooledfund.org/Document/Download/7559) evaluated the comprehension and legibility of various alternatives for signing at midblock hybrid beacon pedestrian crossings. The results indicated that no significant differences were found between the alternatives; however, they did highlight the need for a sign, at least initially, while drivers are learning what actions to take based on the flashing beacon. As a result, FHWA proposes to add a word message sign for jurisdictions that determine the operational need at pedestrian hybrid beacons.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed but with revisions to the sign legend based on comments received in Section 2B.60.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard prohibiting the use of bicycle signal faces at a pedestrian hybrid beacon. FHWA proposes this because the speed at which bicyclists are able to enter and traverse the crosswalk would make it unsafe to allow a green or yellow bicycle symbol signal indication to be shown at the same time that a flashing red signal indication is shown to motorists. If the motorists are shown a steady red signal indication for the entire length of time that the bicycle signal face is showing a green or yellow bicycle symbol signal indication and a red clearance interval, the hybrid beacon would essentially be functioning as a traffic control signal, and not as a pedestrian hybrid beacon.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this topic.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>The FHWA proposed a prohibition of bicycle signal faces at pedestrian hybrid beacons in a new Chapter 4H, consistent with Interim Approval 16 (IA–16), which states, “bicycle signal faces shall not be used in any manner with respect to the design and operation of a pedestrian hybrid beacon.” Though comments varied on this change, a number of commenters expressed concern that such a change would leave no solution to improve safety for bicyclists. However, the change is actually intended to address the fact that bicyclists are vulnerable road users and that they benefit from applying a safe system approach, which is to separate them in time and space from conflicting traffic movements. Where the crossing is a shared-use path or bicycle traffic is otherwise expected, the use of the PHB could contravene this approach. This specific issue is discussed in detail in this section.</p>

	<p>Some of the commenters supported the proposed text to prohibit bicycle signal faces at PHBs, including some city and State transportation agencies. However, a number of the public comments opposed the prohibition of bicycle signal faces at PHBs, noting that some agencies currently have these in operation (Portland, Oregon; and Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona.) without any known safety issues. Some commenters suggested that the prohibition of bicycle signal faces with a PHB would not allow for bicycle movements (since bicyclists are not pedestrians) when PHBs are used at neighborhood bikeway or trail crossings. Other commenters noted the known problem with bicycles entering crosswalks controlled by PHBs during the flashing red and flashing Don't Walk interval, suggesting that this conflict can be addressed by allowing bicycle signal faces.</p>

	<p>The FHWA retains the NPA language that prohibits bicycle signal faces at PHBs based on the following considerations. Intersections of streets and shared-use paths are a vehicle-vehicle intersection because bicycles operate as vehicles in this situation. The PHB was developed as a pedestrian-specific device based on representative pedestrian behavior and characteristics. A pedestrian-type traffic control would not be appropriate for bicycle traffic operating as vehicles with much higher relative speeds than pedestrians and therefore violates road user expectancy and introduces a safety risk for bicyclists due to the manner in which the clearance interval operates. The clearance interval for a PHB allows roadway traffic to proceed after stopping during the flashing red interval as pedestrians clear the crosswalk during the flashing Don't Walk interval. The slower speed of pedestrians provides for visibility of pedestrians and adequate detection time by the vehicle operator, in contrast with the relatively higher speed of bicycle traffic that might enter the crossing more suddenly.</p>

	<p>The FHWA notes that the suggestion that bicycle traffic would not be allowed at a crossing with a PHB absent a bicycle signal face tends to disregard the fact that other treatments could be considered to accommodate the safe mobility of bicyclists. Further, each traffic control device is developed for specific purposes. Therefore, it is not correct to assume generally that any traffic control device can be applied in any condition or be adapted to conditions for which it was not intended without evaluation of its efficacy under those conditions that differ, including for differences in the types of road users and their distinct behaviors and needs. The PHB is an intermediate solution between a flashing beacon and a full signal because it assigns right-of-way and provides positive stop control, but then allows roadway traffic to proceed once pedestrians have cleared their side of the travel lane(s), reducing vehicle delay and congestion, often in urban conditions where congestion can impact the quality of life of surrounding residents and business owners. In the absence of a similar intermediate option for bicycles operating as vehicles, operation of a fully signalized crossing is a potential solution, with little difference in the infrastructure compared with a PHB. The FHWA believes that an agency would decide to prioritize safety considerations for bicyclists as vulnerable road users over congestion or delay concerns for roadway traffic in such a case. These considerations are part of the process for determining the potential effects on the surrounding community environment, including residents and business owners.</p>

	<p>In practice, some of the agencies that have installed bicycle signals with PHBs, as referenced by commenters, have done so in a manner that violates the provisions of the MUTCD for the operation of the PHB, shortening the flashing red interval to a mere few seconds while extending the steady red, allowing the pedestrian clearance (flashing Don't Walk) interval during the steady red facing roadway traffic (along with the green and yellow bicycle signal intervals). In effect, these agencies are operating the PHBs as full signals, but have modified their phasing in a noncompliant manner in order to circumvent the warrants for a traffic control signal. As described earlier, an agency may decide that a full signal is the appropriate solution at a shared-used path crossing if there is appreciable bicycle demand. Further, the noncompliant operation of the PHB presents expectancy violations to both the pedestrian and roadway vehicle operator, potentially putting vulnerable road users at risk. The FHWA believes the provisions, as adopted, meet FHWA's statutory obligation under Section 11135 of BIL to provide for the protection of vulnerable road users to the extent practicable based on available research on the operation of PHBs as a pedestrian safety treatment.</p>

	<p>Following the issuance of this final rule, FHWA will seek opportunities to explore and evaluate data on variations in PHBs that might safely accommodate bicycle signal face use at crossings and, potentially, new research on this topic as might be determined necessary to evaluate such factors as the appropriate clearance interval, adequate separation of pedestrians and bicyclists at the signal, actuation of the bicycle signal, and representative bicyclist and driver behavior at various types of signal indications or combinations thereof.</p>

	<p>Finally, as emphasized previously, roadway owners have the authority to consider other treatments to accommodate the safe mobility of bicyclists, whether traffic control devices whose applications comply with the MUTCD, or other strategies, such as geometric or roadway configuration changes.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>427. In Section 4J.03 (existing Section 4F.03) Operation of Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons, FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph recommending that pedestrian hybrid beacons operated as part of a coordinated signal system should not have a variable flashing yellow interval duration on a cycle-by-cycle basis.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed but revised to be a separate paragraph so that the duration of yellow interval should not vary, even if it is not part of a signal system.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance that the pedestrian hybrid beacon should remain in the dark condition after a pedestrian actuation has been received until the point in the background cycle when the flashing yellow interval needs to begin to maintain the system coordination. FHWA proposes this change in accordance with Official Ruling No. 4(09)–32(I) (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/
4_09_32.htm).
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to add a new Option allowing the pedestrian hybrid beacon to remain in dark condition after a pedestrian actuation until the minimum dark time has been provided, if the minimum dark time has been set on the controller.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed. FHWA received comments that the minimum dark time was not defined and to provide more information in this section since this is the only place it is mentioned in the MUTCD. Based on the comments, a Support is added to describe the minimum dark time.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Option allowing the use of a steady red clearance interval after the steady yellow change interval.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed. </p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option allowing the alternating	flashing	CIRCULAR	RED	signal indications to continue for a short period after the pedestrian change interval has terminated to provide a buffer interval for pedestrians. FHWA proposes these two new Options to increase safety and in accordance with Official Ruling No. 4(09)–14(I) (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/
4_09_14.htm).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add an Option to allow a pedestrian hybrid beacon in close proximity to an active grade crossing to be preempted.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as a Guidance rather than an Option, recommending rather than merely allowing preemption.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a Standard requiring a pedestrian hybrid beacon to flash circular yellow signal indications to each major street approach and requiring the pedestrian signal heads to revert to the dark condition when placed into a flashing mode by a conflict monitor or manual switch. The proper signal and pedestrian displays for pedestrian hybrid beacons placed into flashing mode are not addressed in the current MUTCD and this new standard is intended to provide uniformity and consistency for road users.</p>
