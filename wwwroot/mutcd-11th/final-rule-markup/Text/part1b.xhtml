    <h3><span class="text_added">Section 1B.01 National Standard</span></h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>9. FHWA proposes to add a new Section 1B.01, titled,
“National Standard,” with text relocated from the existing Introduction. As a part of this change, FHWA proposes to revise existing Paragraph 2, Sentence 2, of the Introduction, from a Standard to a Support, as
it is a statement of fact rather than a mandate of the MUTCD.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard indicating the types of facilities to which the MUTCD shall apply and not apply, per 23 CFR 655.603(a). FHWA proposes this revision to make the MUTCD easier for users to understand its applicability, particularly for smaller agencies and individual owners of roads open to public travel.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed except that in P3, item D is deleted, as it is obvious that the MUTCD does not apply to internal areas in buildings.</p>

	<h3 id="section1B02"><span class="text_added">Section 1B.02 State Adoption and Conformance</span></h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Section 1B.02, titled,
“State Adoption and Conformance,” with text relocated from the existing Introduction and existing Section 1A.07. FHWA proposes this revision to consolidate information about the adoption of the MUTCD by States and other Federal agencies and substantial conformance of State MUTCDs and Supplements.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new section and relocated text are adopted as proposed, except that Guidance P2 recommending review of State manuals or supplements for applicable provisions is deleted. The Guidance is not needed as Federal regulation already exists on this topic.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard paragraph to clarify the fact that, in addition to State MUTCDs or Supplements, any policies, directives, or other supplemental documents that a State or other agency might issue to address traffic control devices are considered supplements to the MUTCD and must be in substantial conformance with the national MUTCD. This proposed change is for clarification purposes and does not represent a change to existing requirements.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new Standard paragraph is adopted, but with revisions to clarify that it only applies to documents that change or modify Standard, Options, or Guidance provisions in the MUTCD.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add Guidance indicating that traffic control devices that have been granted Interim Approval, but which have not yet been adopted into the national MUTCD, should not be included in State MUTCDs or Supplements. FHWA proposes this revision to clarify the process for such cases because the technical conditions or status of an Interim Approval are provisional in nature and can change before adoption into the MUTCD. Adoption into State Manuals or Supplements can create a burden for those States for which a legislative change would be required to comply with any new or revised provisions that FHWA might issue. FHWA proposes this change to ensure that an Interim Approval can accommodate flexibility by responding readily to any changes that might become necessary.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new Guidance is not adopted, in response to numerous comments and because the Guidance is unneeded in view of other provisions in this Section.</p>

	<h3 id="section1B03"><span class="text_added">Section 1B.03 Compliance of Devices</span></h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>11. FHWA proposes to add a new Section 1B.03, titled,
“Compliance of Devices,” with text relocated from the existing Introduction and existing Sections 1A.07 and 1A.10. FHWA proposes this revision to consolidate information regarding the compliance of traffic control devices to streamline and improve the usability of the MUTCD.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise an existing Standard relocated from Section 1A.07 to Support. FHWA proposes this revision since the statement is of fact rather than a mandate of the MUTCD.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Support paragraph clarifying the status of devices or applications not specifically addressed in the Manual. FHWA proposes this revision to address a common misperception that an application of a device is allowed if it is not explicitly prohibited in the Manual, even if that application is not addressed in the Manual. In those cases in which there might be some question as to whether an application that is not specifically mentioned in the MUTCD might be allowed, an individual is encouraged to seek an official interpretation, in which FHWA can evaluate whether such application is consistent with the provisions for that device and whether it would adversely impact uniformity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Support paragraph is adopted as proposed, except that the final sentence is changed from Support to Guidance, because FHWA is the official interpreter of the Manual and agencies should contact FHWA when considering a new practice or application not addressed in the MUTCD. Also, an additional Support paragraph is added to inform practitioners of FHWA’s as-needed interpretations of the MUTCD which could lead to the issuance of official interpretations or interim approvals.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to combine a Standard paragraph and an Option paragraph regarding the replacement of non-compliant traffic control devices, relocated from the Introduction, into a single Standard. FHWA proposes this revision to streamline existing language.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that the previous Option text is separated from the Standard and restored as an Option and edited for improved clarity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Also, in response to comment, in P4, “resurfacing, restoration, or rehabilitation” of a facility are added to the types of federal-aid projects to which the MUTCD applies, for accuracy, to match the current (updated) language of the cited CFR.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to remove 12 rows in Table 1B-1 (existing Table I–2), titled, “Target Compliance Dates Established by the FHWA.” FHWA proposes this revision since these rows contain requirements with previously established compliance dates that have passed or will have passed by the date of the publication of the Final Rule resulting from this NPA.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of Table 1B-1.</p>

	<p>Related to this proposed change, FHWA proposes to delete additional compliance dates from the table that are in effect at the time this NPA is published but expire prior to the effective date of the Final Rule.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add three new compliance dates to Table 1B–1 (existing Table I–2). For Section
2C.25 Low Clearance Signs, the compliance date of five years from the effective date of the final rule for
this edition applies to the proposed new Standard
requiring that if used, Low Clearance Overhead signs shall indicate the portion of the structure with low clearance if the posted clearance does not apply to the   entire   structure   to   indicate   the   point   of applicability. The proposed changes were based on recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) H–14–11 4 to provide signing indicating the proper lane of travel for over height vehicles	traveling	under	an	arched	structure. (https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReport s/Reports/HAR1401.pdf.)
</p>

	<p>For Section 8B.16 High-Profile Grading Crossings, the compliance date of five years from the effective date of the final rule for this edition applies to the proposed	  new		Guidance	recommending	the installation of Low Ground Clearance and/or Vehicle Exclusion  and  detour  signs  for  vehicles  with  low ground clearances that might hang up on high-profile grade  crossings.  The  proposed  compliance  date applies only to those locations with known histories of vehicle		hang-ups	   occurring		because		sufficient geometric  criteria  do  not  currently  exist  by  which agencies could evaluate crossings to determine the specific types of vehicles that could be problematic. The	proposed		 changes	 were	based	 on recommendation  from  NTSB  H–18–24  to  provide signing			for	high-profile		grade		crossings. (https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReport s/Reports/HAR1801.pdf).</p>

	<p>For Section 8D.10 through 8D.13 Highway Traffic Signals at or Near Grading Crossings, the compliance date of ten years from the effective date of the final rule for this edition applies to the determination and installation of the appropriate treatment (preemption, movement prohibition, pre-signals, or queue cutter signals) at highway-rail grade crossings in close proximity to signalized intersections. FHWA proposes this compliance date due to the high potential for train-vehicle crashes at locations where a vehicle traveling in a platoon can come to a stop on a crossing unintentionally due to a queue from a downstream signalized intersection.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>Compliance dates for four provisions are adopted in this final rule. The compliance dates are summarized in Table 1B–1 of the MUTCD and are described in detail herein. In addition, one compliance date from a previous rulemaking  remains in effect.</p>

	<p>In Section 2B.64, Paragraph 14 requires that an additional Weight Limit sign, with an advisory distance or directional legend, shall be located in advance of the applicable section of highway or structure so that prohibited vehicles can detour or turn around prior to the limit zone. The NPA proposed changes to give operators of vehicles affected by weight limit restrictions adequate information about the distance to the restricted area so that they can properly change their route and to minimize potential damage to highway infrastructure as a result of an overweight vehicle; however, there was no compliance date proposed for these changes. Based on comments and to provide further clarity in this final rule, the two separate paragraphs from the 2009 edition are retained but the proposed elevation of the Guidance to a Standard is adopted with added text to clarify that the first Standard relates to posting at the applicable section of highway and structure, rather than in advance. The FHWA adds a compliance date of 5 years for the Standard in Paragraph 14 requiring the posting of the additional Weight Limit sign with the advisory distance or directional legend. The FHWA believes a 5-year compliance date is appropriate based on the critical nature of the infrastructure in that it allows agencies up to 2 years to adopt the MUTCD and 3 additional years for agencies to program, fund, and install any devices necessary.</p>

	<p>In Section 2C.25, based on comments from the NTSB, the Standard which redesignated the W12–2 sign as an advance sign is adopted with revised language to warn road users of vertical clearances less than 14 feet 6 inches, or vertical clearances less than 12 inches above the statutory maximum vehicle height, whichever is greater. All States have statutory maximum vehicle heights of 13 feet 6 inches or greater, thus making the 12 inches above the statutory maximum vehicle height the prevailing criterion. However, in the interest of clarity and safety, the specific language for clearances less than 14 feet 6 inches is added to make it abundantly clear that signing for lesser vertical clearances is required. Further, the use of the existing W12–2a and new W12–2b signs is adopted as an Option to supplement, rather than be used in lieu of, the advance warning sign. The FHWA also adopts the Guidance as proposed in Paragraph 8 which recommends that for an arch or other structure under which the clearance varies greatly, two or more Low Clearance Overhead (W12–2a or 12–2b) signs should be installed on the structure itself to indicate the portions of the roadway over which the low clearance applies. This change was based on recommendations from NTSB H–14–11  to provide signing indicating the proper lane of travel for overheight vehicles traveling under an arched structure. The FHWA received comments relating to the proposed compliance dates for a guidance statement and confusion about the applicability based on the structure type. In this final rule FHWA clarifies their applicability to arch or similar type varying height structures and the application of a compliance date when a sign is not required, in the case of the recommendation for posting in Paragraph 8. Based on the critical nature of the infrastructure, FHWA adopts a compliance date of 5 years for both Paragraph 1 (required posting of the low clearance in advance of the structure) and Paragraph 8 (recommended posting of variable low clearances on the structure, unless determined based on engineering considerations that the recommended posting is not needed at that location).</p>

	<p>In a previous and separate rulemaking, a standard for the minimum level of retroreflectivity that must be maintained for pavement markings was established along with a compliance date which became Revision 3 to the 2009 edition of the MUTCD. As a result, FHWA incorporates the provisions from that completed rulemaking into Section 3A.05. The compliance provision is only for implementation and continued use of a method that is designed to maintain retroreflectivity of longitudinal pavement markings, and the compliance date is September 6, 2026.</p>

	<p>The NPA included a compliance date of 5 years for the new Guidance in Section 8B.16 recommending the installation of Low Ground Clearance and/or Vehicle Exclusion and detour signs for vehicles with low ground clearances that might become immobilized or hung up on high-profile grade crossings due to their undercarriages being too low to clear the roadway profile at the track crossing. The proposed compliance date applied only to those locations with known histories of vehicle hang-ups occurring, because sufficient geometric criteria do not currently exist for agencies to evaluate crossings to determine the specific types of vehicles that could experience hang-up situations. Comments on this section acknowledged the value of detour signing for low clearance vehicles in certain cases but suggested there are too many variables in terms of geometric conditions and the types of vehicles and vehicle combinations to adequately identify the risk of these vehicles hanging up at a grade crossing. There were also comments that suggested signing for all vehicles that could potentially hang up at crossings would result in excessive signing and driver confusion. There were also comments about the proposed compliance date, suggesting instead that devices should be brought into compliance through routine maintenance operations. Despite the challenges, FHWA acknowledges the need, as recommended in the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) recommendation H–18–024, to provide guidance to agencies to help identify and address high-profile crossings, especially those that are known from past experience to be subject to specific vehicle type hang-ups. The text provides Guidance and Support to assist agencies in addressing these situations through signing. The compliance date applies to known potential vehicle hang-up locations that are currently identified by agencies through their grade crossing inventory. The FHWA adopts the Guidance and Support statements as proposed, including compliance dates.</p>

	<p>The NPA included a compliance date of 10 years for evaluation and installation of appropriate treatments), including preemption, movement prohibition, pre-signals, or queue cutter signals, for highway traffic signals located at or near grade crossings. Commenters indicated that the costs to evaluate and implement these treatments at highway traffic signals can be significant and may not align with the agency's other priorities. Commenters also pointed out that the number of impacted locations varies greatly by State creating a significant challenge for some States to meet the proposed compliance date. Comments suggested that devices should be brought into compliance through the systematic replacement and upgrade of traffic control devices and not subject to a compliance date. This final rule adopts the compliance date for Sections 8D.09 through 8D.12 with revisions to require only an assessment and determination of appropriate treatment to reach compliance at specific locations. Agencies will be granted flexibility to determine the schedule for installation of improvements based on availability of funding and other safety priorities through the systematic replacement and upgrade of traffic control devices as currently prescribed in the MUTCD for other traffic control devices.</p>

11, and change from Guidance to Standard.
</p>
	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add Standards, Support, and Guidance paragraphs further addressing the experimentation process.

	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>The FHWA recognizes the importance of innovation in traffic control devices for the improvement of traffic safety and operations, particularly for vulnerable road users and automated vehicles. The FHWA, in this final rule, greatly expands this section in a number of areas to better help practitioners in preparing experimentation plans. In the NPA, FHWA proposed to create a new section specifically related to experimentation, now Section 1B.06 (formerly part of Section 1A.10 in the 2009 MUTCD), with Standard, Support, and Guidance paragraphs describing the experimentation process, which provides for evaluation of new traffic control devices or applications under controlled conditions. As part of those changes, FHWA clarified the existing paragraph regarding the elements to be provided in an agency's request for experimentation from a Guidance to a Standard, and expanded the requirements, including specification of the timing of submitting semi-annual progress reports documenting the approved experiments.</p>

	<p>Many commenters supported the need for experimentation and thoughtful process associated with it to provide uniformity and safety for road users; however, many commenters stated that they believe the experimentation process is getting more complicated. Commenters suggested that the existing process hinders innovation to the point of it becoming impossible to pursue due to the steps and time required. As a result, some agencies stated that resource restrictions prevent them from engaging in experimentation and therefore only a handful of States/agencies can afford to experiment. Several organizations and State and local departments of transportation suggested FHWA retain the experimentation process as Guidance, as opposed to Standards, and simplify it. Several commenters also suggested that the requirement for devices to be free from protection by patents, trademarks, etc. is overly burdensome and stifles innovation. They suggested that FHWA allow targeted patented and proprietary products to be used in the experimentation process without patent holders having to forfeit their proprietary protections and allow FHWA to consider these products based on their safety impacts, rather than having them precluded from the experimentation process before their benefits are known. Other comments ranged from allowing agencies to use engineering judgement to determine the appropriate course of action without making a request for experimentation to allowing the default assumption that experimentations may stay in place beyond the end of the experimentation period unless FHWA determines that the experimentation has created an unacceptable safety or operational issue. There were also several comments about the experimentations themselves, including the requirement for control sites, and the desire to coordinate research resources to support local agencies with data collection efforts and research partnerships.</p>

	<p>In consideration of the comments, FHWA adopts a new Option to streamline the process for requesting official experimentation. This new Option allows a requesting agency to submit an abstract of the experimental concept for preliminary review of its viability and potential alignment with other ongoing or previous research on the concept. The FHWA frequently engages with agencies prior to submission of an official request, and the new Option should reduce burdens on agencies by deferring or eliminating the need to develop a full research plan in the event that FHWA identifies a solution that complies with the MUTCD.</p>

	<p>An agency will sometimes submit a request for experimentation with a new device or application to address a need that, instead, could be addressed with devices that comply with the MUTCD. If an existing compliant solution is identified, the need for experimentation to develop and consider a new device or application is eliminated. To further assist agencies in preparing requests for experimentation, clarifying language is added stating that if one of the required items is not applicable for the specific device or application, those items are required to be addressed in the request with a brief explanation as to their non-applicability. The FHWA adopts this change to confirm that each of the required items has been addressed, even if some of the items do not apply to the particular type of experimental device or application or based on the evaluation methodology.</p>

	<p>The FHWA retains the Standard requiring official approval to experiment with a traffic control device that does not comply with the provisions of the MUTCD on any street, highway, bikeway, or site roadway open to public travel. This Standard is a clarifying statement of the existing process that is necessary to limit use of non-compliant devices or applications and minimize any safety risk from experimental features, help ensure that experiments contain adequate provisions to determine effectiveness, and provide national documentation of results. The experimentation process ensures that efforts to solve safety or operational problems with new traffic control devices employ objective, data-driven approaches rather than subjective, anecdotal, or stochastic approaches that could result in unintended adverse effects. The FHWA understands that the experimentation process is of concern due to the level of analysis required, which can take time and financial resources. However, the MUTCD is the national standard for traffic control devices; therefore, deviation requires specific permission through experimentation approval. It is important to understand that nothing about the experimentation process prevents States or local communities from making decisions regarding the geometric design or land use pattern of a community for any reason, including to improve safety for vulnerable road users. The parameters regarding experimentation are intended to help ensure the experimental application does not introduce unintended risk or confusion into the transportation network due to noncompliant traffic control devices or applications. The type and level of analysis associated with experimentation helps ensure experimentation provides useful information for later decisionmaking on additional research, potential revisions to the MUTCD, or advancement of a concept through Interim Approval pending rulemaking. Therefore, the required basic elements for all experiments do not change though the specifics of how they are applied vary by the device being evaluated and the context of its use. In many cases, simple experimentation provisions can fully address the necessary basic requirements and often in ways that are not prohibitively expensive. For example, field evaluation of a new device intended to improve motorist yielding at crosswalks might require only simple vehicle yielding counts by a trained observer at various intervals over a period of time to compare conditions before and after implementation. The cost of experimentation is completely dependent on the type of analysis needed to adequately evaluate the device or application.</p>

	<p>The FHWA retains the existing MUTCD prohibition on patented or proprietary traffic control devices, including under experimental consideration, and adds language to clarify that this provision is actually a limitation that applies to traffic control devices, but not necessarily to certain aspects of those devices, such as their component parts. The FHWA has sufficient rationale for precluding patented devices in the MUTCD, including a long-standing history of uniformity issues when patented devices were used on roadways. Given that the purpose of experimentation is to test devices or applications for national applicability and potential or eventual inclusion in the MUTCD, allowing patented devices into the experimentation process would serve no purpose because eventual inclusion of a device into the MUTCD would still require relinquishing those rights. Further clarification on the extent to which the MUTCD limits and allows patented items is provided in Section 1D.06.</p>

	<p>The FHWA also retains the existing provision subjecting experimental traffic control devices to removal following the conclusion of the experiment. Requiring the removal of experimental devices after an experiment has ended when those devices are not being considered for adoption in the MUTCD is necessary for consistency with the MUTCD being the national standard for traffic control devices, with non-compliant devices only being allowed during experimentation. Experimental devices that are shown to be sufficiently effective based on appropriate levels of experimentation are sometimes issued an Interim Approval official ruling and then become available for use by all agencies requesting their use. Experimental devices that lead to Interim Approvals are generally allowed to remain in place after the experimentation period during the Interim Approval issuance process.</p>

	<p>Control sites, which are sites with similar characteristics to the experimentation site but without the experimental treatment itself, are typically considered essential for scientifically sound research on traffic control devices, as they allow for comparison of data to minimize the effects of variables that are not part of the study. However, FHWA agrees that for certain types of device evaluations or applications control sites may not be necessary to ensure sound research results. The FHWA therefore revises that requirement to allow for other equivalent evaluation methodologies to be used. In addition, a clarifying support statement is added allowing a single experimentation request from multiple jurisdictions wanting to experiment with the same device. Similarly, jurisdictions can potentially be added to an approved existing experiment underway by a different jurisdiction, thereby reducing the time and expense in experimenting with a device. This approach differs greatly from Interim Approval, as the sites in the added jurisdictions are required to be evaluated under the same experimentation plan.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA is developing experimentation guidelines separate from the MUTCD that will provide helpful direction in planning, submitting, and evaluating an MUTCD experiment with traffic control devices. The experimentation guidelines will include background information on research, how to find assistance, and practical examples of device experimentation across different levels of complexity. In response to noted concerns, the guidelines will seek to streamline understanding of experimentation with traffic control devices, as well as reduce financial or institutional barriers that local agencies, in particular, might experience in this area. This document is currently in development and will be published after the completion of this rulemaking.</p>

Beginning with the 11th edition, the designation includes the consecutive edition number, in parenthesis, following the MUTCD Part number. The number that follows the Pat and edition numbers is the sequential number of the official ruling for that Part and edition. The type of official ruling is denoted in parentheses by the letter I, E, or C for interpretation, experimentation, or change, respectively. For example, Official Ruling "4(11)-20 (I)" denotes the twentieth official ruling for Prat 4 of the 11th edition of the MUTCD, which is an official interpretation.</span></p>

The reference to the year of the edition is discontinued and replaced with the consecutive number of the edition beginning with the 11th edition of the MUTCD.</span></p>
