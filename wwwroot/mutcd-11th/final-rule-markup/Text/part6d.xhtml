    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D01_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">Because flaggers are responsible for public safety and make the greatest number of contacts with the public of all highway workers, they should be trained in <span class="text_deleted">safe</span><span class="text_added">proper</span> traffic control practices and public contact techniques. Flaggers should be able to satisfactorily demonstrate the following abilities:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="guidance">
      <li>Ability to receive and communicate specific instructions clearly, firmly, and courteously;</li>

      <li>Ability to move and maneuver quickly in order to avoid danger from errant vehicles;</li>

      <li>Ability to control signaling devices (such as paddles and flags) in order to provide clear and positive guidance to drivers approaching a TTC zone in frequently changing situations;</li>

      <li>Ability to understand and apply <span class="text_deleted">safe</span><span class="text_added">proper</span> traffic control practices, sometimes in stressful or emergency situations; and</li>
