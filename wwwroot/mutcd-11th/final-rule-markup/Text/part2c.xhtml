    <h1>Chapter 2C. Warning Signs And Object Markers</h1>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>109. As part of the reorganization to improve usability of the MUTCD, FHWA proposes to include subchapter headings in Chapter 2C to organize sections into related groupings. FHWA proposes the following subchapters in Chapter 2C: General, Horizontal Alignment Warning Signs, Vertical Grade Warning Signs and Plaques, Roadway Geometry Warning Signs, Roadway and Weather Condition Signs and Plaques, Traffic Control and Intersection Signs and Plaques, Merging and Passing Signs and Plaques, Miscellaneous Warning Signs, Supplemental Plaques, and Object Markers.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The reorganization of Chapter 2C is adopted as proposed, except that the title of the sixth subchapter is revised to “Merging, Two-Way Traffic, and No Passing Signs and Plaques” to more accurately reflect the content.</p>
	</div>

<h2><span class="text_added">General</span></h2>

    <span class="text_deleted"><h3>Section 2C.01 Function of Warning Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>110. FHWA proposes to delete existing Section 2C.01 Function of Warning Signs because this information is captured in Chapters 1A and 2A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion is adopted as proposed.</p>
	</div>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="support">Warning signs call attention to unexpected conditions on or adjacent to a highway, street, or private roads open to public travel and to situations that might not be readily apparent to road users. Warning signs alert road users to conditions that might call for a reduction of speed or an action in the interest of safety and efficient traffic operations.</span></p></span>

    <h3 id="section2C01">Section <span class="text_deleted">2C.02</span><span class="text_added">2C.01<span class="text_deleted change_from_npa"> Function and</span></span> Application of Warning Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>111. FHWA proposes to renumber and retitle existing Section 2C.02 to “Section 2C.01 Function and Application of Warning Signs.”</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The renumbering is adopted as proposed. The title is changed to “Application of Warning Signs” because none of the text in this section deals with function, as that information is in Chapters 1A and
2A.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard, referencing the existing requirements in Chapter 2A, requiring that all warning signs shall be retroreflective or illuminated. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with Section 2B.01. FHWA also proposes to delete all the Option and Support statements because they restate information already covered in Chapter 1A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

In situations where the condition or activity is seasonal or temporary, the warning sign should be removed or covered when the condition or activity does not exist.</span></p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>112. In Section 2C.02 (existing Section 2C.03) Design of Warning Signs, FHWA proposes to add a Support regarding the use of shapes other than diamond- shaped for freeway overhead installations and a reference to Chapter 2A for information on modifications where lateral space is constrained.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise Option P4 to clarify that word message warning signs other than those provided in this Manual may be developed and installed by State and local highway agencies for conditions not addressed by standard signs. FHWA proposes this additional language to clarify the allowable use of word message warning signs that are not in the MUTCD. FHWA proposes this clarification in response to an apparent misinterpretation of the existing provisions, in which noncompliant field deployments have unnecessarily modified the word legends of standard signs where used for the condition stated in the MUTCD.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add an Option statement allowing the use of static or flashing LEDs within the sign border to enhance the conspicuity of the sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Option statement is not adopted but is instead revised to Support referencing Section 2A.12, where the same information is located.
</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, in response to comment, an Option is added to specifically allow use of a Warning Beacon in combination with a standard warning sign. This is a restoration of text that the NPA proposed to delete. This information is appropriate and helpful to MUTCD users, and it is consistent with Part 4.</p>

	<p>113. In Section 2C.03 (existing Section 2C.04) Size of Warning Signs, FHWA proposes to revise the Guidance paragraph regarding the minimum size of diamond-shaped warning signs to restrict the provision to exit and entrance ramps at major interchanges connecting an expressway or freeway with an expressway or freeway.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are all adopted as proposed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A request to add a Standard requiring that the minimum sizes be applied to low-speed roadways, sites open to public travel, and low volume roads is not adopted. There are conditions on conventional roads other than those suggested that can sometimes make it necessary or advisable to use the minimum size. Limiting use of the minimum size by a Standard statement provides insufficient flexibility.</p>
	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Guidance statement recommending 36″ x 36″ as the minimum size for all diamond shaped warning signs facing traffic on exit and entrance ramps at all other interchanges. FHWA proposes these changes because the operating characteristics of a single lane ramp can be closer to that of a single lane conventional roadway than that of a freeway, with the exception of freeway/ expressway to freeway/expressway connections. The proposed language reaffirms the minimum recommended sizes and larger sizes can be used based on engineering judgement, when appropriate.</p>
	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement regarding the size of warning signs used on low- volume rural roads with operating speeds of 30 mph or less to capture language in existing Part 5 FHWA proposes to redistribute among the remaining parts.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>114. In Section 2C.04 (existing Section 2C.05) Placement of Warning Signs, FHWA proposes to delete the second sentence of P3 because it is not needed as the preceding guidance discusses placement with respect to perception-reaction time and the use of engineering judgment as well as referencing Section
2A for the placement of warning signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion of the third sentence of P3 is adopted as proposed (it was incorrectly described as the second sentence in the NPA). Several commenters requested that the sentence be retained, but that request is not adopted because the phrase "not too far in advance" is undefined and makes this sentence lack any usefulness.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete P6 regarding the placement of warning signs that advise road users about conditions that are not related to a specific location, and instead include that information in Table
2C–4.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, but the information is added in Table 2C-3.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes updates to Table 2C–4 by referencing the 2018 AASHTO Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, 7th Edition and providing for advance placement distances at higher speeds.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The updates to the Table, which is actually Table 2C-3, are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to modify Condition B to place the AASHTO Stopping Sight Distance minimum design guidelines in the “0” column for STOP conditions placing Advance Traffic Control signs further in advance of the intersection providing greater advance notice of the critical intersection stop condition, a factor of safety for legibility distance, and more space on the intersection approach for lane control and guide signing.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The modifications to Condition B of Table 2C-3 are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment opposing the changes to Table 2C-3 Condition B in the "0 mph" column (pertaining to signal/stop/yield ahead sign placement), stating a concern that the change will result in agencies having thousands of these signs that would need to be relocated in order to comply, is not adopted. The Guidance states the distances should be applied with engineering judgment. If there is a particular location where placing the sign closer than the distance in the table is based on an engineering reason, the provisions allow this.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>115. In Section 2C.05 (existing Section 2C.06), retitled, “Horizontal Alignment Warning Signs—General,” FHWA proposes to delete the Standard statement regarding use of horizontal alignment warning signs. Instead, FHWA proposes new Option and Guidance statements regarding various treatments, including items other than traffic control devices, and factors to consider for other traffic control devices to warn road users of a change in horizontal alignment or to provide guidance in navigation.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete existing Table 2C–5 and replace it with two tables in proposed Section
2C.06. As part of this change, FHWA proposes to move the portion of the Standard related to speed differential to proposed Section 2C.06 so that it appears in the same section with the referenced tables. FHWA proposes these changes based on a research study (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/NCHRP03-106_FR.pdf) that evaluated advance warning treatments at horizontal curves.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that a new Support statement is adopted rather than a new Option, and existing Table 2C-5 is replaced with a single new Table 2C-4 incorporating both determination of need and selection of devices.</p>

	<h3 id="section2C06">Section 2C.06 Device Selection for Changes in Horizontal Alignment</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>116. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled “Section 2C.06 Device Selection for Changes in Horizontal Alignment.” This proposed new section contains Standard, Support, and Option statements, as well as new tables, to assist practitioners in determining the type of device to be used in advance of horizontal curves on freeways, expressways, and roadways. FHWA proposes this new section to assist practitioners with the selection of the appropriate device for warning of a change in horizontal alignment.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that P1 Standard is revised in response to a comment suggesting that Chart A of Table 2C-4 shall first be used to determine the need for devices and then Chart B of Table 2C-4 shall be used to determine the type(s) of devices to be applied.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, the final sentence of P1 is modified to eliminate the “whichever is higher” portion of the standard. FHWA received a number of comments from various agencies noting that in many cases the
85th percentile speed is not available. This change is consistent with other Sections of the Manual where the term “whichever is higher” is not used. This is also consistent with Official Ruling 2(09)-2(I), which stated highway agencies have the flexibility to determine, based on engineering judgment, which speed value to use for the tangent approach to a horizontal curve (posted or statutory speed limit, 85th percentile speed, or prevailing speed). Additionally, when it is determined that a curve warning sign with an advisory speed plaque will be installed for an approach to a curve, the decision as to which speed value to use shall be documented in the engineering study that is required in Section
2C.59 for the determination of the advisory speed.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>117. In Section 2C.07 Horizontal Alignment Signs (W1–1 through W1–5, W1–11, W1–15), FHWA proposes to edit and move P2 from a Standard to Guidance. FHWA proposes to recommend the use of a Turn (W1–1) sign instead of a Curve sign in advance of curves where the advisory speed is half or less of the posted speed or a speed differential of 25 mph or more. FHWA proposes these changes to allow engineering judgment if a Turn sign does not fit the field conditions. Also, the proposed change in criteria to a speed differential limits the use of the Turn sign where the sign would otherwise be required on lower speed roadways with small differentials between the posted speed and the advisory speed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change of P2 from Standard to Guidance is adopted as proposed, but the text is reverted to the 2009 language indicating that the Turn sign should be used if the horizontal curve has an advisory speed of 30 mph or less. This change simplifies the criteria for determining Turn vs Curve sign use, but also allows engineering judgment to be used when the severity of the curve is not such that the use of the Turn sign would be appropriate, such as on lower speed roadways where the geometric conditions are better portrayed by the use of the curve sign.

	<p>118. In Section 2C.08 (existing Section 2C.09) Chevron Alignment Sign (W1–8), FHWA proposes to add Option and Standard statements regarding the use of LEDs when used within Chevron Alignment signs to enhance the conspicuity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Based on a significant number of comments received, the Standard prohibiting the sequential flashing of chevrons is not adopted and the new Option is adopted with revisions to delete reference to concurrent flashing of LEDs. FHWA notes that previous research (Highways for Life Publication No. FHWA-15-CAI-012 and Indoor Simulator and Field Study Evaluation of Sequential Flashing Chevron Signs on Two-Lane Rural Highways Report No. FHWA-SA-18-075) did not compare the sequential flash pattern to a simultaneous flash at once per second, which is the current MUTCD requirement for flashing LEDs. However, between the simulator and field studies conducted in the research, the treatment showed effectiveness in reducing speeds. FHWA believes that further research is necessary to determine an optimum flash pattern and rate to ensure that the operation of the chevrons appears synchronized to an approaching driver when the number of chevrons in view can vary by location. In concert with this change, a prohibition on use of the Chevron Alignment sign in the central island of a roundabout is added to be consistent with changes adopted in Section 2C.10 for the One-Direction Large Arrow sign, because this sign is used for curves, turns, and changes of alignment and is not appropriate for direction of traffic entering a roundabout or neighborhood traffic circle where that traffic must yield to traffic in the circulatory roadway. This change is also consistent with other related changes in Chapter 2B.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>119. FHWA proposes to delete existing Section 2C.10 Combination Supplemental Horizontal Alignment/ Advisory Speed Signs (W1–1a, W1–2a), because there is considerable evidence that the signs are not being used as a supplement in accordance with the Standard, since many take on the form of an Advance Warning sign and are placed in advance, rather than at the location of the hazard. To address the need to remind road users of the advisory speed at a location downstream of the advance warning location, FHWA proposes the Confirmation Advisory Speed Plaque (W13–1aP) described in proposed Section 2C.59.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion of existing Section 2C.10 and the W1-1a and W1-2a signs is adopted as proposed. Comments that the W1-1a and W1-2a signs should not be removed from the MUTCD are not adopted, for the reasons cited in the NPA preamble and for the safety of users on horizontal curves. For changes in horizontal alignment, it is misleading to have an advance warning sign being placed at the point of the hazard and the sign was not being used correctly as a supplement, especially where visibility of the curve is limited.

	<p>120. In Section 2C.10 (existing Section 2C.12) One- Direction Large Arrow Sign (W1–6), FHWA proposes to revise Option P1 to allow use of the One-Direction Large Arrow sign either as a supplement or alternative to Chevron Alignment signs or delineators to delineate a change in horizontal alignment. FHWA proposes this change to reflect the results of a recent study on driver response to traffic control devices (http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/docs/NC HRP03-106_FR.pdf) and resulting desire to revise MUTCD language to clarify the use of devices in areas with change in horizontal alignment.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete Standard paragraph 7 prohibiting the use of the One-Direction Large Arrow sign in the central island of a roundabout and instead proposes to allow its use in a new Option. FHWA proposes to allow the use of the sign in conjunction with the proposed changes to remove existing Section 2B.43 for Roundabout Directional Arrow Signs. FHWA proposes these changes to provide agencies with an Option to use a warning sign within the roundabout instead of, or in addition to, a One- Way sign to direct traffic counterclockwise around the central island.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed deletion of the prohibition on use of the One-Direction Large Arrow sign in the central island of a roundabout and the proposed new Option to allow such use are both not adopted. The prohibition is restored and the Option is not adopted, because this sign is used for curves, turns, and changes of alignment and is not appropriate for direction of traffic entering a roundabout or neighborhood traffic circle where that traffic must yield to traffic in the circulatory roadway. These changes are consistent with other related changes in Chapter 2B.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>120. FHWA proposes to combine existing Sections 2C.14 and 2C.15 and renumber and retitle the resulting section as, “Section 2C.12 Advisory Exit and Ramp Speed Signs (W13–2 and W13–3) and Combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Exit and Ramp Speed Signs (W13–6 through W13–13).”</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The combination, renumbering, and retitling of the section is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add Standard, Guidance, and Option statements clarifying the use of these signs, including how they are to be used together, where applicable.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added statements are adopted as proposed, except as noted below.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to reference the proposed new tables in Section 2C.06.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The reference in P1 of the new tables is not adopted, because that reference was incorrect. Instead, P1 is revised to state that the W13-2 shall be used where an advisory speed is posted in advance of a freeway or expressway exit and W13-3 signs shall be used where an advisory speed is posted in advance of a conventional road ramp or to another roadway or roadside facility. As the provisions for their use were outlined later in the section, those Standard and Guidance provisions are relocated to the subsequent P3 and P4 to make the provisions for the use of these signs clearer.</p>

	<p>In the proposed new Standard, FHWA proposes to require that the ramp geometries depicted on the Advisory Exit or Ramp Speed signs be limited to the standard designs of the proposed Combination Horizontal Alignment/ Advisory Exit Speed and Combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Ramp Speed signs. While this limitation is implicit in the existing provisions of Section 2A.04 (existing Section 2A.06) that prohibit alternatives to standard signs or other uses of symbols, FHWA believes that a specific  statement in this proposed Section would help to ensure that the proposed Combination signs are used only for those conditions at exit ramps that are atypical or unexpected. This limitation would minimize overuse of the Combination signs, which could result in a reduction of their effectiveness. Where typical or expected geometry exists at or near the ramp terminal, the Advisory Exit or Ramp Speed (W13–2 or W13–3) signs would continue to be used. FHWA proposes these new signs to provide agencies and practitioners greater flexibility to sign for various unexpected conditions at or near ramp terminals.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This new Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition to the existing signs in the Manual that display the 270-degree loop arrow (W13–6 and W13–7), FHWA proposes Exit and Ramp Combination signs depicting the following geometric conditions:
The 180-degree horseshoe curve arrow, the 90-degree turn arrow, and the truck rollover symbol and arrow.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new signs are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In this new Standard, FHWA also proposes to incorporate an existing requirement previously contained in Table 2C–5 for the use of Advisory Exit Speed and Advisory Ramp Speed signs on turning roadway exits and ramps when the difference between the speed limit and the advisory speed is 20 mph or greater.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to recommend in a new Guidance that the Advisory Exit Speed and Advisory Ramp Speed signs on turning roadway ramps be used when the difference between the speed limit and the advisory speed is 15 mph or greater.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add that Regulatory Speed Limit signs should not be located in the vicinity of exit ramps or deceleration lanes, particularly where they would conflict with the advisory speed displayed on the Advisory Exit or Ramp Speed signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In a revised Option, where there is a need to remind road users of the recommended advisory speed, FHWA proposes to allow a horizontal alignment warning sign with an advisory speed plaque to be installed at a downstream location along the ramp.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes new Guidance for the installation of a horizontal alignment warning sign if there are changes to the ramp curvature and the subsequent curves have advisory speeds that are lower than the initial ramp curve speed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option for the use of the One-Direction Large Arrow (W1–6) sign beyond the exit gore on the outside of the curve to provide additional warning of an immediate change in curvature. FHWA proposes the changes in this new combined section to clarify the use of these signs and provide additional flexibility for their use on ramps where the speed differential is small, or where road users need reminding of the advisory speed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting addition of an Option to allow the color of the numerals to be fluorescent yellow-green in school zones is not adopted. Instead, an exception to the yellow color requirement for numerals is added specifically citing Sections 6H.01 (work zones) and 7B.01 (schools).
Another comment requesting that flashing of the numerals for excessive speed be allowed is not adopted, because flashing violates the MUTCD provisions for changeable message signs, can add to the time to read the message, and can be distracting to drivers. A number of comments opposed the new provisions that (1) only allow the sign or plaque with a horizontal alignment warning sign and not other warning signs with advisory speeds, and (2) requiring mounting the sign as a supplement to a horizontal alignment warning sign rather than a plaque beneath as proposed and adopted for the use with a speed limit sign. These comments are not adopted. More than 25 percent of fatal crashes are associated with a horizontal curve, and the vast majority of these crashes are roadway departures. The average crash rate for horizontal curves is about three times that of other types of highway segments. About three-quarters of curve-related fatal crashes involve single vehicles leaving the roadway and striking trees, utility poles, rocks, or other fixed objects—or overturning. Allowing the sign to supplement advisory speeds for other signs has the potential for over-proliferation of the device and further research is needed. Existing research (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/14020/14020.pdf) on the use and the placement showed most sites had decreases in mean speeds. With respect to mounting the sign supplemental to the advance warning sign and advisory speed plaque, this is also consistent with the cited research for placement of the device and concerns regarding the amount of information on the assembly if mounted with the sign and advisory speed plaque as well as the resulting mounting heights.

	<p>127. In Section 2C.24 (existing Section 2C.26), retitled,
“DEAD END, NO OUTLET, and ROAD ENDS Signs
(W14–1, W14–1a, W14–2, W14–2a, W8–26, W8–
26a),” FHWA proposes to change the term “cul-de- sac” to “turnaround” in Option P1 to reflect the
roadway geometry more accurately.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in Option P1 are not adopted. Based on comments, the phrase “terminates in a dead end or turnaround” is replaced with “terminates without intersecting another street,” to eliminate any misunderstanding of the meanings of the two deleted terms.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete Standard P4 prescribing the design of the sign, because sign design details are required to comply with existing requirements in Chapter 2A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Deletion of Standard P4 is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a new Option for signs for ROAD ENDS and STREET ENDS for use on the approach to the end of a conventional road or street.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Option is adopted as proposed, except that, similar to P1, reference to “dead end or turnaround” is deleted and replaced with the phrase “where the street terminus is not apparent.”</p>

	<p>In concert with these new signs, FHWA also proposes a Guidance paragraph recommending the use of object markers to mark the end of the road or street if the new signs are used, presuming that the need for the sign would be based on low visibility of the end of the road or street.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new Guidance paragraph is not adopted. Instead, a new Support paragraph is added referring to Section 2C.73 regarding use of object markers.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard statement prohibiting the use of the proposed new ROAD ENDS and STREET ENDS signs at the entrance to a dead- end road or street as the DEAD END and NO OUTLET signs are designated specifically for that purpose.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>128. In existing Section 2C.27, renumbered and retitled, “Section 2C.25 Low Clearance Signs (W12–2, W12–2a, W12–2b),” FHWA proposes several revisions to clarify the signing practice for locations where the clearance is less than 12 inches above the statutory maximum vehicle height. FHWA proposes these changes to provide agencies with additional information for placing signs in advance of and on structures with low clearance. The proposed changes were based on recommendations from NTSB H–14–
11 to provide signing indicating the proper lane of travel for over height vehicles traveling under an
arched structure (https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR1401.pdf).</p>
	<p>As part of these changes, FHWA proposes to designate the existing W12–2 sign as a Low Clearance Ahead sign, and the existing W12–2a and a proposed new W12–2b sign as a Low Clearance Overhead sign, to indicate the portion of the structure with low clearance if the posted clearance does not apply to the entire structure.</p>
	<p>FHWA proposes a compliance date of 5 years based on the critical nature of the infrastructure.</p>
	
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of Paragraphs 1 and 8 and the associated compliance date.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">P3 Guidance is adopted with revised language based on an NTSB comment, to clarify more specifically under what conditions the clearances should be evaluated.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">P5 adds new guidance for the advance warning of low clearances on intersection roads or freeway or expressways exits for the use of a rectangular warning sign with an appropriate word legend and to not use the W12-2 sign. This recommendation is in the interest of safety and ensuring that road users have adequate warning when exiting onto roadways with low clearances and no opportunity to detour.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">P7 introduces an Option in response to a number of commenters who disagreed with the removal of the ability to place the W12-2 on a structure. FHWA agrees with the commenters and adds the option for when physical conditions on a structure limit the width such that the W12-2a or W12-2b signs are physically unable to fit (such as on wooden or metal trestle bridges), a W12-2 sign may be installed overhead on the structure or post-mounted in front of the structure, in addition to the required W12-2 sign at the advance location.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard in P9 is revised in response to comment to clarify that the sign is to be placed over the lane or shoulder with the low clearance point.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Guidance in P10 is added to recommend that the clearance shown on the W12-2 sign should match the clearance on the overhead versions, and if there are multiple overhead versions, should match the lowest clearance. This recommendation is added to ensure the safety of road users, the integrity of the infrastructure, and to ensure that enough advance warning is provided for the lowest possible clearance ahead.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>In Section 2C.25, based on comments from the NTSB, the Standard which redesignated the W12–2 sign as an advance sign is adopted with revised language to warn road users of vertical clearances less than 14 feet 6 inches, or vertical clearances less than 12 inches above the statutory maximum vehicle height, whichever is greater. All States have statutory maximum vehicle heights of 13 feet 6 inches or greater, thus making the 12 inches above the statutory maximum vehicle height the prevailing criterion. However, in the interest of clarity and safety, the specific language for clearances less than 14 feet 6 inches is added to make it abundantly clear that signing for lesser vertical clearances is required. Further, the use of the existing W12–2a and new W12–2b signs is adopted as an Option to supplement, rather than be used in lieu of, the advance warning sign. The FHWA also adopts the Guidance as proposed in Paragraph 8 which recommends that for an arch or other structure under which the clearance varies greatly, two or more Low Clearance Overhead (W12–2a or 12–2b) signs should be installed on the structure itself to indicate the portions of the roadway over which the low clearance applies. This change was based on recommendations from NTSB H–14–11  to provide signing indicating the proper lane of travel for overheight vehicles traveling under an arched structure. The FHWA received comments relating to the proposed compliance dates for a guidance statement and confusion about the applicability based on the structure type. In this final rule FHWA clarifies their applicability to arch or similar type varying height structures and the application of a compliance date when a sign is not required, in the case of the recommendation for posting in Paragraph 8. Based on the critical nature of the infrastructure, FHWA adopts a compliance date of 5 years for both Paragraph 1 (required posting of the low clearance in advance of the structure) and Paragraph 8 (recommended posting of variable low clearances on the structure, unless determined based on engineering considerations that the recommended posting is not needed at that location).</p>

	<p>134. In Section 2C.36 Advance Traffic Control Signs (W3–
1, W3–2, W3–3, W3– 4), FHWA proposes to change the last sentence of Standard P1 related to visibility criteria for traffic control signals based on distances
specified in Table 4D–2 to a Guidance to allow
agencies more flexibility.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This section is renumbered Section 2C.35. The change to the Standard in P1 is not adopted as proposed in the NPA. A comment in Section 2C.36 and comments in Part 4 disagreed with the change based on the safety of drivers. FHWA agrees as it is important for the safety of the road user to have the warning sign installed when the view of the signal faces is not sufficient.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to combine and revise existing Option statements to allow for the use of LEDs within the border of the sign to enhance conspicuity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that text that would allow the border LEDs to be flashed is not adopted. LEDs cannot be used with a WHEN FLASHING plaque. LEDs are for sign conspicuity and are only to be used all the time or when actuated but are not to be used with a WHEN FLASHING plaque. A part-time warning beacon indicating that a condition is in effect differs from LEDs used within a sign as a conspicuity enhancement. While a warning beacon can be used for conspicuity, that is not its only function (and is not its function in this case). The WHEN FLASHING message requires a warning beacon for this purpose. This is consistent with Section 4S.03. In addition, a comment requesting to add “or when the 85th-percentile speed or the posted speed limit is 25 mph or lower” to the conditions when engineering judgment should determine the treatment to be implemented is not adopted, because no justification was provided and insufficient visibility of a signal, stop sign, or yield sign is important to address with warning signs even at low speeds. Further, based on a comment, the phrase “or in advance of a section of roadway that regularly experiences traffic congestion” is removed from Option P7 as it is not appropriate to use the BE PREPARED TO STOP sign for congestion that is not related to a traffic signal.</p>

FHWA proposes this change based on Synthesis of Non-MUTCD Signing (<a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/34772/dot_34772_ DS1.pdf">https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/34772/dot_34772_ DS1.pdf</a>),33 which found that at least 20 State agencies currently use a sign that warns of the possibility of stopped or almost stopped traffic due to turns or other unexpected conditions, and therefore recommends adding the sign to the MUTCD. In accordance	with	this	recommendation,	FHWA proposes to add the W23–3 to Figure 2C–4 and Table 2C–1.</p>

	<p>135. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2C.37 Actuated Advance Intersection Signs (W2–10 through W2–12),” that contains Support, Option, and Standard paragraphs regarding the use of Actuated Advance Intersection Signs to allow agencies flexibility in implementing warning systems in the vicinity of traffic signals or other intersection conflict areas. FHWA proposes these signs, and the associated legends, based on information	from	a	Pooled	Fund	Study (<a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/16061/16061.pdf">https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/16061/16061.pdf</a>).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The addition of the new section is adopted as proposed (and relocated to become Section 2C.42), but the signs and certain associated text are revised. The WATCH FOR ENTERING TRAFFIC (W2-11) sign is removed because the W2-11 sign is an inappropriate sign for an actuated system that displays real-time warnings, as denoted by the section title. The appropriate sign for use is the W2-
10 sign, which includes the legend WHEN FLASHING. The word “uncontrolled” is also added in two of the Option paragraphs, for accuracy.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, in the final paragraph Standard, the phrase “an actuated warning system that activates when an approaching vehicle is detected” is replaced with “a warning beacon (see Section
4S.03) that activates when a vehicle on a conflicting approach is detected”, for accuracy.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting to add a sign with the legend TRAFFIC ENTERING is not adopted because it can be misinterpreted to mean that traffic is always entering rather than just when flashing. This is an inappropriate legend, given the other available existing signs.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>144. In Section 2C.47 (existing Section 2C.42), retitled “Lane Ends Signs (W4–2, W9–1),” FHWA proposes several changes to reflect the proposed deletion of the LANE ENDS MERGE LEFT (RIGHT) (W9–2) sign. FHWA proposes deleting this sign, and instead adds new Support and Guidance statements to clarify the use of the Lane Ends (W4–2) and RIGHT (LEFT) LANE ENDS (W9–1) signs, including how to use them together, where applicable, to warn road users of the reduction in the number of lanes. </p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The W9-2 sign is deleted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a Guidance statement to clarify the Lane Ends (W4–2) sign should be used to indicate the approximate location of the start of the lane taper. FHWA proposes these changes and the deletion of the W9–2 sign to provide consistency in signing for a reduction in the number of lanes, as the W9–2 sign is a word message for which a symbol sign (W4– 2) already exists. In addition, a research study (<a href="https://pooledfund.org/Document/Download/7559">https://pooledfund.org/Document/Download/7559</a>)	which examined the use of these signs, as well as new alternatives, showed that the W4–2 and W9–1 had the best recognition, while the W9–2 sign had a greater legibility distance.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance regarding locations for placement of the W4-2 Lane End sign is adopted with significant revisions based on comments. Instead of placement at the start of the taper, the sign should be located at the advance placement distance specified by Table 2C-3. This is an advance warning sign, so it should be located in advance of where the lane starts ending. The W9-1 sign provides supplemental advance warning and therefore the proposed Guidance recommending its use is revised to an Option for use and placement upstream of the W4-2 sign.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Option that allows the W9–1 sign to be located at the far-side of the intersection on low-speed roads in urban environments where space is limited at a signalized intersection.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Option is adopted but with simplified language that deletes text about low-speed and urban environments and instead refers to when the lane ends a distance beyond an intersection that is less than the Table 2C-3 distance.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes allowing supplemental RIGHT (LEFT) LANE ENDS (W9–1) signs upstream of the W9–1 that is installed at the advance placement distance.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option is not adopted, as there is no need for a second W9-1 sign further upstream from the W9-1 that precedes the W4-2 sign.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Guidance statement to recommend that if supplemental W9–1 signs are installed, a Distance plaque should be installed below the W9–1 sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This new Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<h3 id="section2C49">Section 2C.49 HEAVY MERGE FROM LEFT (RIGHT) Sign (W4-7)</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>146. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2C.49 HEAVY MERGE FROM LEFT (RIGHT) Sign (W4–7).” The new section contains an Option to use a new HEAVY MERGE FROM LEFT (RIGHT) XX FT Sign (W4–7) to provide supplemental warning to advise road users of congested lanes at interchanges. A sign with the legend THRU TRAFFIC MERGE LEFT (RIGHT) was proposed in the 2008
NPA but was not adopted in the Final Rule. FHWA received a request to include the THRU TRAFFIC sign based on the Synthesis of Non-MUTCD Signing (<a href="https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/34772/dot_34772_ DS1.pdf">https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/34772/dot_34772_ DS1.pdf</a>), which found that at least 11 State agencies currently use such a sign and it should therefore be added to the MUTCD. FHWA proposes to add the W4–7 with a HEAVY MERGE FROM LEFT (RIGHT) XX FT legend to Figure 2C–8 and Table 2C–2 as this legend depicts the warning to drivers more accurately of the potential for a large volume of entering traffic rather than the THRU TRAFFIC legend, which warns through traffic to vacate those lanes, because it implies that the lane is ending. The MUTCD already contains standard signs to indicate that a lane is either ending or is for exit traffic only.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new section is adopted as proposed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, the “XX FT” legend is deleted from the sign and instead an Option is added to allow the W4-7 sign to be supplemented with an appropriate distance plaque.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">FHWA received a number of comments both in support of and opposed to the inclusion of this section. Comments suggesting the new sign and the entire new section be removed are not adopted. The commenters suggested that THRU TRAFFIC KEEP LEFT (RIGHT) would be more advisable for the condition. As noted in the NPA preamble, that sign is not appropriate. The Heavy Merge sign is intended to warn of the merge, not to dictate thru traffic or imply that a lane on the right will be a lane drop.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion of the Standard P2 is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The added Option is adopted but with revisions to also allow the distance to be displayed on a plaque.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, Option P1 is revised to replace the phrase “on a ramp at the next interchange or intersection” with “at the next exit”, to clarify that the sign is intended for use on freeways and expressway exits and not in advance of conventional road intersections.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting the word “FOR” be deleted from the sign legend is not adopted, because the NPA modified this sign from its 2009 legend to ensure that it is clear that the right lane is only for the exit and not that exit traffic just has to use the right lane.</p>

	<p>150. FHWA proposes to renumber and retitle existing Section 2C.08 as, “Section 2C.59 Advisory Speed Plaque (W13–1P) and Confirmation Advisory Speed Plaque (W13–1aP)” to reflect the proposed addition of a new use for the optional plaque to supplement a One- Direction Large Arrow Sign (W1–6) to remind road users of the advisory speed through the curve. The proposed W13– 1aP plaque is redesignated from E13–1P, which is an existing plaque currently allowed beneath Exit Gore signs to confirm the advisory exit speed posted at an upstream location. FHWA proposes to redesignate this plaque and expand its use to the similar application on the outside of the beginning of any alignment change following a Horizontal Alignment Advance Warning sign assembly. The proposed expanded use of this plaque would replace the existing Combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Speed signs in existing Section
2C.10.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, Standard P3 is revised to clarify that the speed differential in Table 2C-6 shall be the difference between the horizontal curve’s advisory speed and the roadway’s posted speed limit, statutory speed limit, or the 85th percentile speed on the approach to the curve.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes a new Standard paragraph limiting the allowable use of the Confirmation Advisory Speed plaque only to supplement a One-Direction Large Arrow (W1–6) or an Exit Gore (E5–1 series) sign and not as a separate sign installation. FHWA proposes this limitation on the use of the plaque because the plaque was designed and intended specifically for these two uses, which are to supplement, near the beginning of the alignment change, an advisory speed that is posted at the advance location in an Advance Warning sign assembly.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new Standard paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete existing Items A through C in Support P7 and all of Support P8, and instead refer to the Traffic Control Devices Handbook for information on established engineering practices for determining advisory speeds for a horizontal curve. As part of this change, FHWA proposes to add items A through E, which list established engineering practices.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes to the Support regarding established engineering practices are adopted but with revisions based on numerous comments asking that the ball- bank method’s three listed criteria not be deleted as the NPA proposed. The criteria are restored, as they do provide useful information for practitioners and eliminate the need to consult another publication.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, based on a comment, Guidance is added to clarify that when an Advisory Speed Plaque is used with a warning sign that is also supplemented with another plaque such as the commonly used Advance Street Name sign plaque, the Advisory Speed Plaque should be mounted directly below the primary warning sign, with the additional plaque below the Advisory Speed Plaque. This Guidance provides needed clarity for jurisdictions and reflects common practice.</p>

	<p>152. FHWA proposes to delete existing Section 2C.60 SHARE THE ROAD Plaque (W16–1P) and replace it with a new proposed Section 2C.66 IN ROAD and IN STREET Plaques (W16– 1P, W16–1aP) that contains Option and Standard statements regarding the use of these optional signs to warn drivers to watch for other forms of slower transportation traveling along the highway, such as bicycles, golf carts, or horse-drawn vehicles. Since its adoption in the 2000 MUTCD, research (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136973#sec013">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0136973#sec013</a>) has shown that the “share the road” message when applied to bicyclists does not adequately communicate the responsibilities of either user group on the roadway. Road users are unclear whether “share the road” means that drivers should give space when passing or that bicyclists should pull to the side to allow drivers to pass. FHWA is proposing the IN ROAD/IN STREET plaques to replace the SHARE THE ROAD plaque based on this research and for consistency with all in road vehicle types.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2C.67. The changes are adopted as proposed, except that based on comments, the word “pedestrians” is added to Option P1 as another slower form of transportation, and Option P3 is revised to Support to merely refer to Section 9B.14.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A request for deletion of the last phrase in the Standard paragraph, which prohibits mounting these plaques alone, is not adopted, because plaques are never intended to be mounted alone and a general prohibition is stated in Section 2B.67.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>153. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2C.67 Except Bicycles Plaque (W16–20P).” The new section contains an Option to use a new Except Bicycles plaque below a warning sign
where it is appropriate to notify bicyclists that the conditions depicted by a warning sign are not applicable to bicycles. An example is a roadway which terminates as a dead end or cul-de-sac but serves as a continuous route for bicycle travel through the use of connecting paths or barrier opening and the plaque would be used to supplement a DEAD END or NO OUTLET warning sign. This section also includes a new Standard statement that if used with a warning sign, the plaque shall be a rectangle with a black legend and border on a yellow background, consistent with similar provisions for the color of supplemental plaques.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2C.68. The changes are adopted as proposed, except the Standard statement is deleted because the plaque is a standardized design and thus the statement is not needed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment suggesting that Option P1 be revised to refer to “bicycles and other micro-mobility users” instead of just bicycles is not adopted. Agencies could decide to change the legend of an otherwise- standard plaque to "Except Bicycles and Scooters" or perhaps three or more types of conveyances, and this could introduce confusion. Instead, agencies can develop their own word-message-only variants of the W16-20P plaque for a given condition.</p>

	<p>154. In Section 2C.71 (existing Section 2C.65) Object Markers for Obstructions Adjacent to the Roadway, FHWA proposes to add a new Option permitting the use of Type 2 or Type 3 object markers to mark an obstruction adjacent to the roadway. The existing MUTCD has a Standard that currently implies this optional use of Type 2 and Type 3 object markers. FHWA proposes this change to clarify the intent of the provisions.</p>
	<p>FHWA also proposes to change existing Standard P2 and P3 to Guidance and revise the language regarding object markers applied to approach ends of guardrail and other roadway appurtenances to specify crash cushion terminals as the other roadway appurtenances. The revision also recommends that the Type 3 object marker should be directly affixed, without a substrate, and generally conform to the size and shape of the approach end of the guardrail or crash cushion. FHWA proposes this change because the term “roadway appurtenances” is not defined in the MUTCD and FHWA wants to eliminate any potential confusion that may occur between this Guidance paragraph and the existing Support statement in this section which lists numerous obstructions where object markers are applied.</p>
