    <h1>Chapter 2J. Specific Service Signs</h1>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>283. FHWA proposes to replace “logo” with “business identification” signs throughout Chapters 2J and 2K to recognize that a word legend can and often is used in lieu of a logo to identify the business on the Specific Service sign. This generally occurs when the business to be identified does not have a logo, their logo is not widely recognized, or their logo is otherwise unsuitable for display on the sign. The reclassification does not change the allowance for a business or service provider to use a corporate logo on a Specific Service sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change in terminology from “logo” sign panel to “business identification” sign panel is adopted as proposed.</p>
	</div>

    <h3 id="section2J01">Section 2J.01 Eligibility</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>284. In Section 2J.01 Eligibility, FHWA proposes to delete the 24-hour Pharmacy Specific Service category because there has been little demand and most pharmacies that did obtain a logo on a Specific Service sign have since withdrawn from the associated agency program. Instead, the 24-hour pharmacy would remain as General Service only. FHWA also proposes to remove references to
24-hour pharmacies from Section 2J.02.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The 24-hour Pharmacy Specific Service category is removed as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to remove alternative fuels from the qualifications for a GAS business identification sign panel to eliminate any potential driver expectancy confusion should a facility offer one or more of the many alternative fuels only and not gasoline.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change existing Guidance P10 to Standard, because it is important for States to have a statewide policy for Specific Signing for the program to be successfully implemented in a consistent manner. Such policies already exist in a majority of the States.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">P10 is adopted as Standard as proposed.</p>

    <h3 id="section2J02">Section 2J.02 Application</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>285. In Section 2J.02 Application, FHWA proposes to delete 24-hour Pharmacy Specific Service category from Standard P2 because there has been little demand and most pharmacies that did obtain a logo on a Specific Service sign have since withdrawn from the associated agency program.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Reference to 24-hour pharmacies is removed from Section 2J.02. In response to comments, EV Charging is added as a Specific Service sign category. As a result, provisions for EV Charging specific service signs are added throughout this section.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise existing P2 to address the display of distances explicitly to eligible facilities on the Specific Service signs on the approach to the interchange. While this practice has never been allowed, FHWA proposes this language to provide clarification based on the results of official experimentation and studies demonstrating that the display of distances requires too much time to read and reduces the effectiveness of these signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Revisions to exclude distances to eligible facilities on Specific Service signs on the approach to an interchange are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard statement prohibiting the inclusion of business identification sign panels for alternative fuel facilities on GAS Specific Service Signs for those facilities that offer only alternative fuels, but not gasoline. This addition is because driver expectancy for businesses on the GAS sign is that the business sells gasoline, even if one of the several alternative fuels might also be available.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA also proposes to add a Support paragraph identifying the option to sign for alternative fuel facilities with General Service signs and directing users to Chapter 2I for more information on those provisions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Standard, Guidance, and Support statements limiting the allowable number of business identification sign panels for each Specific Service to six and recommending that when there are more than six eligible facilities for one or more categories of service, General Service signs for those services should be used instead. The proposed Support statement explains that Specific Service signs are intended for areas primarily rural in character, and that when services at an interchange are abundant, the character of the area is no longer primarily rural and the need to identify specific types or brands of facilities is generally unnecessary and General Service signs would be more appropriate.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The limitation to not more than six business identification sign panels on any one sign is adopted with clarifying edits. The proposed Support statement regarding the intended use of Specific Service signs for primarily rural areas is relocated to Section 2J.01 and revised to indicate that General Service signs would be more appropriate at such time when services at an interchange are abundant, since this is an indication that the character of the area is no longer primarily rural.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending that the ATTRACTION Specific Service sign should have no more than four business identification sign panels.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to explain in the Support statement that, because of the considerable variation in the types of attractions found on these signs, and the fact that many do not include well known services or national logos, it is generally more difficult and requires significantly more time to decipher between types of attractions shown on an ATTRACTION sign than for other categories of Specific Service signs where the types of facilities are more uniform.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise existing Standard P3 to clarify that configurations or arrangements of logo sign panels other than those listed are not allowed. FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance and a new Option statement recommending that if a service is no longer available from an interchange or intersection, then the legend displaying the service type and direction information should be removed or may only be covered if there is indication that this service may become available in the near future. This is proposed so that the road user does not misinterpret the sign as indicating that this type of service is still available, similar to the message on a General Service sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Revisions to the Standard and the new Option are adopted as proposed. The new Guidance is adopted with revisions for clarity.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add a new Figure 2J–1 to illustrate an example of General Service Signs in Conjunction with Specific Service Signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Figure is adopted as Figure 2J-3.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>286. In Section 2J.03 Logos and Business Identification Sign Panels, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending that graphic or trademarked logos used on a logo sign panel should be consistent with the on-premise business identification signs at the location of the business that are visible from the roadway. FHWA proposes this recommendation to provide consistency between the logo sign panel and the signing on the business and accommodate driver expectancy and positive guidance.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments, a Standard is added prohibiting the use of scanning graphics that are visible to the road user from the roadway for the purpose of obtaining information on business identification sign panels. This Standard was moved from Section
2A.04. As part of this change, a definition for “business identification panel” is added to Part 1 definitions.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the Option allowing the border to be omitted where business identification symbols or trademarks are used alone for a logo. FHWA proposes this change to ensure consistent apparent size and visibility of the individual logos.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option to omit a border where a business identification symbol or trademark is used alone is deleted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Standard regarding supplemental messages on logo sign panels to prohibit specifically additional amenities or products unrelated to the service category because those items are considered promotional advertising. FHWA proposes this revision to clarify the existing provisions, which do not allow for such messages.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard explicitly prohibiting the display of messages related to the promotion or availability of logo space on Specific Service signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to add an Option to clarify that supplemental messages identifying an alternative fuel available may be added only to the business identification sign panels on the GAS Specific Services sign for a gas facility that provides that alternative fuel in addition to, rather than in lieu of, gasoline. FHWA proposes this change as a clarification of the Option provision allowing supplemental messages for essential motorist information and to accommodate driver expectancy of the nature of the services displayed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option to clarify the addition of alternative fuel available on the GAS Specific Service sign is adopted as proposed. In concert with other changes regarding the addition of provisions for EV Charging and based on comments, an Option is added for the use of the supplemental message EV CHARGING for the service categories of gas, food, lodging, or camping, and the Standard is revised to add eligibility criteria for such use.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Guidance provision regarding the legend and background colors of the supplemental messages, recommending they be a black legend on a yellow background for that portion of the business identification sign panel. FHWA proposes this change to make it easier for motorists to recognize supplemental information that is critical to their decision making.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Revisions to Guidance are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the Option and Standard for the alternative circular RV ACCESS supplemental message to standardize the RV ACCESS supplemental message for consistency.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option and Standard for the alternative RV ACCESS supplemental message are deleted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to revise the Standard regarding business identification sign panel displays to prohibit a panel from displaying more than one name or identification logo/ trademark for the same business and to prohibit marketing slogans. This Standard also does not allow a sign panel to be used to display messages related to the promotion or availability of adding a business identification sign panel. FHWA proposes this change because promotional advertising is not allowed on traffic control devices.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is revised as proposed.</p>

    <h3 id="section2J06">Section 2J.06 Signs at Interchanges</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>287. In Section 2J.06 Signs at Interchanges, FHWA proposes a revision to the Standard indicating that Specific Service signs shall not be used at freeway- to-freeway interchanges, except at ramps that also provide access to a conventional road within that interchange. FHWA proposes this to ensure drivers are not confused by indicating a service is available on the freeway itself.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>To complement the existing Guidance providing recommended minimum spacing between Specific Service ramp signs, FHWA also proposes recommended minimum spacing between Specific Service ramp signs and other signs along the ramp. FHWA proposes this change to ensure that adequate spacing between critical destination, warning, and regulatory signs along the ramp is maintained.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add a new Figure 2J–6 to illustrate an example of Specific Services Signing for a Conventional Road Accessed within a Freeway-to- Freeway Interchange.</p>

	<p>288.

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is revised as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change the Guidance statement to an Option statement to allow, rather than recommend that Specific Service ramp signs display distances to a facility when not visible from the ramp intersection.

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>291. In renumbered Section 2J.12 Signing Policy, FHWA proposes to change to a Standard the recommendation that each highway agency that elects to use Specific Service signs establish a general signing policy and add a requirement for a Statewide policy on the eligibility of service providers. FHWA proposes this change to ensure that States have a policy on eligible businesses for their Specific Service sign program that provides businesses equitable and consistent qualifications for signs, thereby meeting road user expectations while maintaining the recommendations on minimum sign policy criteria to be considered.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is changed to Standard as proposed.</p>
