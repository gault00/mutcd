	<p>509. In Section 6N.01 (existing Section 6G.02) Work Duration, FHWA proposes to change P2 from Standard to Guidance to allow flexibility in the definition of the five categories of work duration at a location.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Support to describe the rolling roadblock method for temporary traffic control based on findings from the NTSB H–17–2 Bus Crash-US 101 San Jose, California
(https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/_layouts/ntsb.recsearch/Recommendation.aspx? Rec=H-17-002).
