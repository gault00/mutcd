	<h1>Chapter 4L. Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons</h1>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>432. FHWA proposes to add a new Chapter numbered and titled, “Chapter 4L Rectangular Rapid-Flashing Beacons” (RRFBs) that includes three new sections and provisions for the application, design, and operation of rectangular rapid flashing beacons used to supplement pedestrian warning signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed with minor edits based on comments received.</p>

	<p>RRFBs consist of two rapidly-flashed rectangular- shaped yellow indications, each with an LED-array based pulsing light source. The proposed provisions are	based on the	Interim	Approval 	21 ( https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia21/index.htm), a research study (http://tti.tamu.edu/2014/06/18/new-rapid-flash-beacon/ and https://static.tti.tamu.edu/tti.tamu.edu/documents/ TTI-2014-5.pdf) performed on the effectiveness of various flash patterns, and FHWA official interpretations (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/
4_376.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/ interpretations/4_09_5.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ resources/interpretations/4_09_17.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_21.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_22.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_24.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot. gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_37.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/
4_09_38.htm, http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/
interpretations/4_09_41.htm) and experimentations. One notable revision from the IA–22 is a new Standard requiring the design of the RRFBs to conform to the requirements for post-mounted or overhead placement described in paragraph 3 of Section 4L.02 if used at intersections. RRFBs have been shown to achieve high rates of compliance at a low relative cost in comparison to other more restrictive devices that provide comparable results, and they have been shown to provide an enhanced level of pedestrian safety at uncontrolled crosswalks that has been previously unattainable without costly and delay-producing full traffic signalization.
</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement in Section 4L.02 to recommend the use of audible information devices with RRFBs to assist pedestrians with vision disabilities. FHWA proposes this revision to provide additional assistance due to the lack of audible traffic cues.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed except the speech message is changed to “Warning lights are flashing” based on comments received.</p>
