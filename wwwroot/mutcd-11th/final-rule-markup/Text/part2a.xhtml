	<h3 id="section2A01">Section 2A.01 Function and Purpose of Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>29. In Section 2A.01 Function and Purpose of Signs, FHWA proposes to delete existing P3 referencing definitions for various roadway types, because the information is repetitive and not necessary.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise this Section to expand on the language from existing P1 regarding the use of signs on a frequent basis to confirm rules of the road or statutes.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, with a minor clarifying change in the first sentence to refer to “permanent signs” rather than all signs, based on a comment.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Guidance provision recommending that agencies use temporary signs when determined necessary to advise of new regulations or as part of an educational campaign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also adds a recommendation on the placement of permanent signs for rules of the road in adjacent jurisdictions. FHWA proposes this new paragraph to limit the amount of signing along a given route to reduce sign clutter and the informational load imposed on the road user and to reduce sign maintenance burdens on the responsible maintaining agency.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Guidance is adopted as proposed with minor editorial changes.</p>

    <h3 id="section2A04">Section <span class="text_deleted">2A.06</span><span class="text_added">2A.04</span> Design of Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>31. In Section 2A.04 (existing Section 2A.06) Design of Signs, FHWA proposes to eliminate the provision in the existing Standard P8 that allows for minor changes to the proportion of symbols. FHWA proposes this change because symbol designs are standardized for recognition based on the specific proportions of the symbol, and this statement contradicts the subsequent standard.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed. The opposing comments do not provide sufficient justification for retaining the allowance for minor changes in symbol proportions.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the existing Option P10 because the subject of orientation is addressed in Section 2A.09 (existing Section 2A.12).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard to clarify that, except where explicitly allowed, the substitution of a word legend for a symbol legend is prohibited where the standard sign legend uses the specific symbol, as it contravenes uniformity in recognition and messaging to road users. This proposed change is for clarification purposes and does not represent a change to existing requirements and is consistent with changes included in the 2009 MUTCD, which discontinued a number of alternate standard signs with word legends for which the primary standard sign included a symbol legend.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed except that, for clarification, “a combination of symbol and words” is added to the prohibition, based on a comment.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Standard that prohibits an alternative sign design or dimensions when there is a standard sign provided in the Manual or detailed in the “Standard Highway Signs” publication, except where specifically allowed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Standard is adopted as proposed.  A request to change the Standard to Guidance because of the need for flexibility for multiple field conditions is not adopted, as the Standard is clear and the Option that follows it provides the flexibility the commenter requested.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a related Standard for standardized sign layouts that might have a variable length legend, but otherwise have a standard dimension. FHWA proposes this change because the standardized designs are often of recognizable form as well as message.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Support paragraph regarding the use of special word legend signs that may be unclear to road users. FHWA proposes this addition to encourage evaluation of such signs to determine comprehension or possible misinterpretation.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete Guidance P15 and revise Standard P14 that describes provisions related to the range of allowable information and graphical symbols affixed to the face and back of a sign. FHWA updates this paragraph to reflect similar forms of information to those listed in the existing P14 and proposes to prohibit the following additional items unless otherwise specified for a specific sign: Telephone numbers, metadata tags (“hash-tags”), quick- response (QR) codes, bar codes, or other graphics for optical scanning.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that, based on several comments, the phrase “quick- response (QR) codes, barcodes, and other graphics for optical scanning” is revised to “scanning graphics”, as it simplifies language and avoids specifying a particular technology. This change in terminology is also adopted for wherever else in the text “scanning graphics” is the more appropriate term. In conjunction with this change of terms, a second paragraph is added to the previous Support to explain the intended meaning of “scanning graphics”.</p>

	<p>In conjunction with this change, FHWA proposes to revise Option P16 to allow for the use of these items for signs that are intended and oriented for viewing by pedestrians only. FHWA proposes these changes to consolidate like information.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Option is adopted as proposed, except that viewing by “driving automation systems” is added as an allowed use.  The request to delete “and not visible to operators of motor vehicles” because it is too restrictive is not adopted, as such displays are too distracting.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise the Standard regarding pictographs to require that they be devoid of QR codes, bar codes, or other graphics designed for optical scanning for the purpose of obtaining information to be consistent with the Standard language described above.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed, except that the term “scanning graphics” is used, as stated previously, and clarification is provided on pictographs used by jurisdictions.  Also, based on a comment, the final sentence of the Standard is revised to clarify that pictographs for colleges or universities shall not include pictorial representations of athletic mascots.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Standard to clarify the existing  prohibition  of  Business  Identification (formerly Logo) sign panels from being displayed on signs except as specifically provided in the Manual. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed added Standard is not adopted in Section   2A.04,  but  appropriate   information   is instead included in Chapter 2J, where it is more appropriately located.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to reiterate and expand the existing Standard from Section 2B.10 prohibiting items other than traffic control signs from being mounted on the back of a sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that “manufacturer name” is added to the allowable items on the back of a sign, based on a comment. This is a common practice and was an inadvertent omission from the NPA text. Also, the term “scanning graphics” is used as noted above.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add an Option permitting the display of date of fabrication, sign designation, sign size, and manufacturer name on the front of a sign face, as well as a Standard specifying the location, maximum letter heights, and letter color.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Option and Standard are adopted as proposed, except that the term “scanning graphics” is used as noted above.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>32. In Section 2A.05 (existing Section 2A.09) Shapes, FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance provision with  recommendations  for  mounting  a  diamond-shaped warning sign where lateral space is constrained.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance is adopted as proposed, except with revisions based on comments that constrained lateral space affects all signs.  Therefore, the revisions apply the Guidance to any standard sign, not just diamond-shaped warning signs.  Also, in item E the guidance against overhanging the roadway is expanded based on comments to include the shoulder or other areas used by bicycles or pedestrians, and item F is not adopted because it could conflict with other provisions regarding maximum sign mounting height.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option to allow a vertically oriented rectangle for the legend of the warning sign when the methods contained in the Guidance are impractical.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Option is adopted as proposed, except that additional text is adopted to provide options for when maintaining overhead-mounted warning sign shape is not practical.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard prohibiting other modifications to sign shapes, such as cutting off the left and right points of a diamond, resulting in a vertical hexagon. FHWA proposes these changes to ensure consistency and recognition of sign shapes and to clarify that “modifying” a sign to fit into constrained locations cannot result in a new, non- standard shape.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, a Standard from Section 1D.06 and Guidance from Section 2B.18 about signs with exclusive shapes not being obscured when mounted on the back of another sign are relocated and adopted with revisions in this section, where it is more appropriately located. Based on comments, the proposed Standard moved from Section 1D.06 is revised to Guidance for consistency with Guidance moved from Section 2B.18. The Guidance is applied to all signs, not just STOP and YIELD signs, and methods for consideration are added. Finally, an Option is added where the described methods for consideration are impracticable.</p>

	<h3 id="section2A08">Section <span class="text_deleted">2A.13</span><span class="text_added">2A.08</span> Word Messages</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>34. In  Section  2A.08  (existing  Section  2A.13)  Word Messages, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard requiring all word messages to be aligned horizontally across a sign, reading left to right, except as provided otherwise in the Manual. FHWA proposes this change to allow for signs that require a vertically oriented message, such as Reference Location signs and the Depth Gauge sign, and to make explicit that words are prohibited on retroreflective sign post strips for enhanced conspicuity. Though this requirement has always been inherent in the designs of the standardized signs in the MUTCD, the proposed statement clarifies the intent.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, based on comments, an Option is added that allows a secondary language, in addition to English, to be displayed on the face of signs, plaques, sign panels, and changeable message signs that are intended for viewing only by pedestrians and occupants of parked vehicles.  The addition of this Option expressly provides the conditions under which such secondary-language messages are allowed, similar to existing provisions that have been retained from the 2009 MUTCD, now in Chapter 4K.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement that requires distances displayed on signs to be in a fraction format, not decimal, except as provided otherwise in the Manual. FHWA proposes this change to be consistent with language found in other Chapters and standardized signs throughout the Manual.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Standard is adopted as proposed. A number of commenters disagreed with this change and favored the flexibility to use decimals; however, the Standard provides consistency throughout the Manual for displaying fractional distances rather than decimals on signs, except as explicitly provided otherwise.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In regard to Paragraph 3 of this section, a request to relocate appropriate text about “Clearview”™ fonts from the Appendix to the main body of Part 2 is not adopted. Series E (Modified) – Alternative to Appendix A1 addresses the operational effect of the Congressional directive in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 that required FHWA to, "... reinstate Interim Approval IA–5, relating to the provisional use of an alternative lettering style on certain highway guide signs, as it existed before its termination, as announced in the Federal Register on January 25, 2016 (81 FR 4083).”</p>

The term loop height refers to the portion of a lower-case letter that excludes any ascending or descending stems or tails of the letter, such as with the letters “d” or “q.” The nominal loop height is equal to the actual height of a non-rounded lower-case letter whose form does not include ascending or descending stems or tails, such as the letter “x.” The rounded portions of a lower-case letter extend slightly above and below the baselines projected from the top and bottom of such a non-rounded letter so that the appearance of a uniform letter height within a word is achieved. The actual loop height of a rounded lower-case letter is slightly greater than the nominal loop height and this additional height is excluded from the expression of the lower-case letter height.</span></p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to eliminate the Option to use recreational and cultural interest area guide sign symbols on streets or highways outside of a recreational and cultural interest area. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with other proposed changes in Chapter 2M.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option is deleted as proposed.  The request to retain the Option is not adopted, as word messages are allowable and intended to be used outside of recreational and cultural interest areas, while recreational and cultural interest area symbols are intended for use inside recreational and cultural interest areas.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>37. In Section 2A.11 (existing Section 2A.15) Enhanced Conspicuity for Standard Signs, FHWA proposes to revise Option P1 to add a maximum period of 6 months for the NEW plaque to be displayed, adding DO NOT ENTER and WRONG WAY signs to the signs that are not allowed to be supplemented by a warning beacon, and allow a rectangular rapid- flashing beacon (RRFB) to supplement a Pedestrian or School warning sign at an uncontrolled, midblock crosswalk. FHWA proposes these changes based on common practice and the proposed addition of the RRFB to the Manual (proposed Chapter 4L).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revisions in Option P1 are adopted as proposed, except that item D is revised, based on comments, to remove the six months maximum period for display of the NEW plaque, and instead a new Guidance is added that the period to display this plaque should be determined by engineering judgment but not more than twelve months.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete the existing Standard prohibiting the use of the NEW plaque alone, because plaques by definition may not be used alone. As a result, this text is unnecessary.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise the Standard to clarify that the display of any legend or other information on the retroreflective strip on a sign support is prohibited. FHWA adds this Standard because some agencies have added vertically arranged supplemental legends in substandard letter sizes on retroreflective strips. The existing Option allowing retroreflective strips does not allow for supplemental legends. FHWA adds this language to clarify the existing provisions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement that prohibits the installation of duplicate signs on the same post facing the same direction of traffic. The allowable methods of enhancing conspicuity do not currently allow this practice, and FHWA proposes this addition to clarify that current practices of this type are not appropriate means for enhancing conspicuity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Standard is adopted as proposed, with minor editorial revisions for clarity and accuracy.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Some commenters requested to change the paragraph specifying the dimensions for placement of retroreflective strips on posts from Standard to Guidance.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>New Section 2A.12 LEDs Used for Conspicuity Enhancement on Standard Signs (not discussed in NPA Preamble)</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A new Section 2A.12 LEDs Used for Conspicuity Enhancement on Standard Signs is inserted and adopted, containing text on this topic relocated from Section  2A.20,  including  the  NPA  proposed changes to such text.  The four proposed revised Standards and two new Standards are adopted but with revisions.  In the fourth Standard paragraph, in response to comment, text is inserted to prohibit the LEDs from protruding outside the sign border or legend, and item F is revised to also allow fluorescent yellow-green as an LED color with school area, bicycle or pedestrian warning signs. These are accepted good practices.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, a new Standard paragraph that prohibits the use of flashing LED units with a Speed Limit sign to indicate that the speed limit is in effect is relocated from Section 4S.04, as this is the most appropriate location for it. Similarly, a new standard is added to clarify the existing prohibition that LED units are not to be used with a WHEN FLASHING legend for the purpose of indicating when a regulatory or warning message is in effect.</p>
	
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting to delete the Option that allows LED units to be used individually within the border or legend of a sign to enhance conspicuity is not adopted. As pointed out by another commenter, there are many good reasons to retain the Option, and the request was not adequately justified.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting to increase the maximum flash rate of LEDs from 60 to 120 times per minute is also not adopted.  Although there is a Canadian study supporting allowable uses of 120 times per minute, such a change would be outside the scope of this rulemaking, but it could be considered for a future edition.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Comments requesting deletion of the requirement for LEDs used in STOP or YIELD signs to operate continuously and not use actuation are not adopted. STOP and YIELD signs are continuously present so if the increased conspicuity offered by LEDS is needed, their continuous operation is critical.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>38. In Section 2A.12 (existing Section 2A.16) Standardization of Location, FHWA proposes to add a new Figure 2A–5 to illustrate the relative locations of Regulatory, Warning, and Guide Signs on an urban signalized intersection approach to help clarify typical signing at these complex situations for practitioners.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2A.13. The added figure is adopted as Figure 2A-4.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change the second sentence of the existing Standard to a Guidance, because the use of the posted or 85th-percentile speed for determining the appropriate sign spacing is just one factor, and there may be other factors that are more appropriate. Changing this to a Guidance statement provides agencies with more flexibility to use the factors they determine, through engineering judgment or study, to be most appropriate.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance provision to recommend that where certain signs indicate an action by a road user in the left lane or at the left-hand side of a one-way road, such as Merge signs, the sign should be located on the left-hand side of the roadway. In the case of a divided road, the sign should be located in the median if adequate width is available.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Guidance is adopted as proposed, with minor editorial revisions for clarity and accuracy.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes revising the existing Guidance to recommend that at locations where there are conflicts between the installation of regulatory and warning signs and a guide sign, that the guide sign should be relocated to another appropriate location where it would still be effective.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes the recommendation that in other cases, such as at a decision point, the guide sign should take precedence over other signs whose locations are not as critical to an immediate decision or action necessary by the road user. In all cases, careful attention should be given to minimizing sign clutter. FHWA proposes this additional information to reinforce the importance of separating critical regulatory and warning information from guidance information so that road users are not overloaded with important information all at one location.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

2A.19. FHWA proposes clarifications in P1 recommending signs should be used and located judiciously, minimizing their proliferation in order to maintain their effectiveness; that signs should be used conservatively; and that sign clutter be avoided.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2A.20.   The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes a new Support statement describing sign clutter consistent with Official Ruling No. 2–669(I) (https://mutcd.fhwa. dot.gov/resources/interpretations/2_669.htm) as well as information regarding vanity signs, which are signs that are requested by an interested party, but are not essential for, or have no relation to, traffic control.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The first paragraph of the new Support is adopted as proposed.  The second paragraph, regarding vanity signs, is adopted with revisions based on comments to delete the use of the term “vanity signs” and instead describe the types of signs that display messages unrelated to traffic operation, navigation, or transportation information  and thereby contribute to sign clutter.  FHWA still refers to these types of signs by the established term, “vanity signs,” but does not include the term in this final rule.</p>

	<p>As part of these changes, FHWA also proposes new Guidance statements recommending that signs and other traffic control devices be installed and maintained from a systematic standpoint rather than individually. FHWA proposes these changes because of the increased proliferation of signs, often installed separately over time, which reduces the effectiveness of signs and distracts road users at decision points and other locations requiring heightened attention.</p>

Sign clutter can result from the overuse of MUTCD-compliant signs and or signs that display information unrelated to traffic operation, navigation, or transportation information. Examples of such signs would include, but are not limited to, those displaying the birthplace or home of a noted person, local sports team accomplishments, population information, and self-described qualities of a community such as "friendly" or "open for business."</span></span></p>

	<p>43. In Section 2A.20 (existing Section 2A.07), retitled, "Retroreflection and Illumination," FHWA proposes to add a new Standard that requires the use of an opaque or non-retroreflective material for a black legend or background. Under headlamp illumination, retroreflective black appears as white, which creates a conflict with the existing requirement for signs to appear similar under daytime and nighttime conditions. FHWA proposes this addition to resolve this conflict.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2A.21.   The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add two Support statements regarding the use of LED units. In concert with these additions, FHWA also proposes to revise existing Standards P7 through P10 and add two new Standards regarding the pitch and placement along the edge of a sign to incorporate additional provisions for LED units to ensure that adequate legibility would be maintained.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are not adopted in but instead all text in Section 2A.21 related to use of LED units in signs, including changes that were proposed, is relocated from Section 2A.21 to new Section 2A.12 (see above), because LEDs do not relate to retroreflection or illumination.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>44. In Section 2A.21 (existing Section 2A.08) Maintaining Minimum Retroreflectivity, FHWA proposes to add to Guidance recommendations for the visual inspection and revised assessment or management methods that should be used to maintain sign retroreflectivity at or above the minimum levels in Table 2A–5 (existing Table 2A–3) and that signs that are below the minimum levels should be replaced.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2A.22.   The added Guidance is adopted as proposed, with some clarifying editorial revisions.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add paragraph headings to define which methods are management methods and which are assessment methods, and to include the three procedures that make up the visual assessment  method.  FHWA  proposes  these additions to clarify the types of methods and to place information that is currently available in other resources in one location.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes were not included in the proposed MUTCD text published with the NPA, as intended, for consistency with Section 3A.03 Maintaining Minimum Retroreflectivity for pavement. However, the NPA preamble was inadvertently not updated to reflect that this was not being included in the proposal.   Additionally, the list of methods for maintaining sign retroreflectivity was removed in the NPA text, but the change was not reflected in the NPA preamble.</p>

	<p></p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Requests from several agencies that operate park and recreational roads requested that brown be restored and not removed as a color that may be exempted from the retroreflectivity maintenance requirements, stating reasons such as brown signs being lower priority signs, the cost of maintenance and replacement for agencies, and roads being closed to the public at night. Those requests are not adopted, as all signs communicate critical information to road users during nighttime, low light, and adverse weather conditions where retroreflectivity is essential for safety on park and recreational roads. Additionally, the language allows agencies sufficient flexibility since signs will be replaced per agency policy taking into account agency budget.</p>

      <li>Visual Nighttime Inspection—The retroreflectivity of an existing sign is assessed by a trained sign inspector conducting a visual inspection from a moving vehicle during nighttime conditions. Signs that are visually identified by the inspector to have retroreflectivity below the minimum levels should be replaced.</li>

      <li>Measured Sign Retroreflectivity—Sign retroreflectivity is measured using a retroreflectometer. Signs with retroreflectivity below the minimum levels should be replaced.</li>

      <li>Expected Sign Life—When signs are installed, the installation date is labeled or recorded so that the age of a sign is known. The age of the sign is compared to the expected sign life. The expected sign life is based on the experience of sign retroreflectivity degradation in a geographic area compared to the minimum levels. Signs older than the expected life should be replaced.</li>

      <li>Blanket Replacement—All signs in an area/corridor, or of a given type, should be replaced at specified intervals. This eliminates the need to assess retroreflectivity or track the life of individual signs. The replacement interval is based on the expected sign life, compared to the minimum levels, for the shortest-life material used on the affected signs.</li>

      <li>Control Signs—Replacement of signs in the field is based on the performance of a sample of control signs. The control signs might be a small sample located in a maintenance yard or a sample of signs in the field. The control signs are monitored to determine the end of retroreflective life for the associated signs. All field signs represented by the control sample should be replaced before the retroreflectivity levels of the control sample reach the minimum levels.</li>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>45. In Section 2A.22 (existing Section 2A.23), retitled, "Median Opening Treatments for Divided Highways," FHWA proposes to delete the existing Guidance and add  new  recommendations  for  signing  a  divided highway  crossing  as  separate  intersections  when specific conditions are present.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The  section  is  adopted  as  Section  2A.23.	The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Figure 2A–6 to illustrate the new recommendations. FHWA proposes these changes to provide additional details for road user safety, based on the results of recently completed research on this topic (http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/178000.aspx).</p>
