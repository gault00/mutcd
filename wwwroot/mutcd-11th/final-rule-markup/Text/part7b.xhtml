    <h1>Chapter 7B. Signs</h1>

    <h3 id="section7B01">Section 7B.01 <span class="text_deleted">Size</span><span class="text_added">Design</span> of School Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>520. FHWA proposes to consolidate and combine information from existing Sections 7B.01 through
7B.07 into one section numbered and titled, “Section
7B.01 Design of School Signs.” FHWA proposes to delete Standards and Guidance that are covered in Section 2A.11 as the information is redundant.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The consolidation of seven existing sections into a single Section 7B.01 is adopted as proposed. Provisions covered in Section 2A.11 are deleted as proposed, however, the Standard requiring sizes in the Oversized column in Table 7B-1 to be used on expressways in school areas is retained because it refers to a table in Part 7 and not to Section 2A.11.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, the Guidance recommending the sizes in the Oversized column should be used on roadways that have four or more lanes with posted speed limits of 40 mph or higher is retained because this is specific guidance for school areas, not covered in Part 2, and it is important for the safety of school children on such wide high-speed roads.</p>

	<p>521. FHWA also proposes to create a new section numbered and titled, “Section 7B.02 School Area Signs and Plaques” using information from existing Sections 7B.08 through Section 7B.10.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change Standard P1 in existing Section 7B.10 to Guidance because many States have higher fines by statute in school zones, work zones, and other locations. Retaining this as a Standard may have an unintended consequence of placing a financial burden on States and municipalities to sign for every location where there are increased fines; therefore, FHWA believes that the use of engineering judgment is more appropriate.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add new Guidance, Standard, and Option paragraphs to clarify the application of Higher Fines Signs and Plaques in school areas based on Official Ruling No. 7(09)–3(I) (<a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/reqdetails.asp?id=7_09_-3__I_">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/reqdetails.asp?id=1150</a>).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 7B.02 is adopted as proposed, except that all text regarding higher fines signs and plaques is relocated to a new Section 7B.06 that deals solely with that topic. This change is made to simplify and make easier to understand the basic signing for school areas, without the complicating language regarding higher fines zones. See Disposition of new Section 7B.06 regarding disposition of proposals in the NPA regarding higher fines zones.</p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7B02_para01">01</span><span class="support">Many state and local jurisdictions find it beneficial to advise road users that they are approaching a school that is adjacent to a highway, where additional care is needed, even though no school crossing is involved and the speed limit remains unchanged. Additionally, some jurisdictions designate school zones that have a unique legal standing in that fines for speeding or other traffic violations within designated school zones are increased or special enforcement techniques such as photo radar systems are used. It is important and sometimes legally necessary to mark the beginning and end points of these designated school zones so that the road user is given proper notice.</span></p>

	<p>522. FHWA proposes to create a new section numbered and titled, “Section 7B.03 School Crossing Signs” by combining information from existing Sections 7B.11 and Section 7B.12.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change a portion of Standard P3 in existing Section 7B.12 prohibiting the use of School Crossing assemblies on approaches controlled by a YIELD sign to Guidance. FHWA proposes this change to revert back to the language in the 2003 MUTCD. NCUTCD suggested this change because the language in the 2009 Edition that prohibited the use of School Crossing assemblies on approaches controlled by a STOP or a YIELD sign was too restrictive. An NCUTCD task force working on this issue cited that the School Crossing assembly provides beneficial guidance to road users on approaches where vehicles are not required to stop; therefore, prohibiting their use where YIELD signs are placed could have a negative effect on the safety of school children. In conjunction with this change, FHWA proposes two new Options allowing a School Crossing Assembly on Yield approaches to roundabouts and channelized right turn lanes controlled by a Yield sign. Also, FHWA proposes to allow a Yield Here To (Stop Here For) Pedestrians (R1–5a or R1–5c) sign in advance of a marked crosswalk on a multi-lane approach in a school zone in accordance with the provisions in Section 2B.20.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change existing Options P4, P5, P6, and existing Standard P8 in existing Section 7B.12 to clarify the application of In-Street Pedestrian Crossing (R1–6 or R1–6a) sign, In-Street School Crossing (R1–6b or R1–6c) sign, Overhead Pedestrian Crossing (R1–9 or R1–9a) sign, and 12- inch reduced size in-street School (S1–1) sign may be used at school crossings on approaches that are not controlled by a traffic control signal, a pedestrian hybrid beacon, or emergency vehicle hybrid beacon. FHWA proposes these changes to eliminate any potential confusion whether the various types of beacons are considered unsignalized intersections.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to modify the name of the In-Street Schoolchildren Crossing sign to In-Street School Crossing sign to be more consistent with other signs that it supplements and more accurately describe the use of the sign.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add an Option to allow an In-Street Pedestrian Crossing or In-Street School Crossing sign at intersections or midblock crossings with flashing beacons.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 7B.03 is adopted as with additional modifications described herein.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Regarding prohibited use of School Crossing assemblies on approaches controlled by a YIELD sign, the proposal to change that from a Standard to a Guidance is not adopted, because with the adopted addition of the two new Options allowing use on certain types of yield-controlled approaches, the Standard clarifies the intent for most cases.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard text is modified to add "except as provided in Paragraphs 9 and 10 of this Section” to specifically refer to those Options.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, in both of the two new Options, “at least one car length” is changed to “at least 20 feet” in response to a comment requesting more clarity.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">For consistency with requirements in Chapter 2B adopted in this final rule, a corresponding new Standard is added requiring in-street or overhead Pedestrian Crossing signs to be used only as a supplement to a School Crossing assembly with a diagonal downward-pointing arrow (W16-7P or W16-7aP) plaque at the crosswalk location.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment recommending deletion of "multi-lane” so as to allow use of R1-5a or R1-5c signs on single-lane approaches to uncontrolled school crosswalks is not adopted, consistent with similar text in Section 2B.19.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Lastly, FHWA received a comment requesting the MUTCD clarify if the School Crossing sign can or cannot be installed on an approach controlled by a traffic signal. FHWA believes that the purpose of these signs is clear and for unexpected conditions. Pedestrians crossing at a signal would not be unexpected. FHWA will consider the need for further clarification in Part 7 and Chapter 2C in a future revision.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>524. FHWA proposed to add a new Section 7B.05 “School Bus Stop When Flashing Signs.” In this section FHWA proposes a new sign, “STOP FOR SCHOOL BUS WHEN RED LIGHTS FLASH” to remind drivers of the requirement to stop for school buses when the flashing red lights on the school bus are in operation. FHWA proposes this new sign in response to a recommendation from the NCUTCD as many States currently use variations of regulatory word messages for this purpose. The new sign would standardize the message for drivers.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new section 7B.05 and the proposed new sign it discusses are not adopted, in view of a significant number of comments opposing the new sign because it states a universally known rule of the road and because the addition of the sign to the MUTCD could lead to sign clutter. Jurisdictions are already able to post a word message sign to remind road users of a specific school bus law and action, especially in areas where there are multiple bus stops, geometric conditions such as multi-lane roadways, or where there has been a particularly high incidence of drivers not stopping for school buses when the red lights are flashing. As a result of removal of this section, the two subsequent sections (7A.06 and 7A.07) are renumbered to 7B.05 and
7B.06, respectively.

	<p>525. FHWA proposes to retitle Section 7B.06 (existing Section 7B.15) “School Speed Limit Signs and Plaques” and incorporate information from existing Section 7B.16.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change Standard P3 in existing Section 7B.15 to Guidance to allow flexibility on required signing for fines in school zones based on engineering judgment. Many States have higher fines by statute in school zones, work zones, and other locations; therefore, requiring the use of the FINES HIGHER, FINES DOUBLE, or $XX FINE plaques could place an undue burden on States and municipalities to sign for every location where there are increased fines.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed retitling and incorporation of information from existing Section 7B.15 is adopted as proposed, except for the following: 1) the section number is changed to 7B.05 because of removal of what had been proposed as Section 7B.05 (see above), and 2) all text regarding higher fines signs and plaques is relocated to a new Section 7B.06 that deals solely with that topic. This change is made to simplify and make easier to understand the basic signing for school speed limit signing, without the complex language regarding higher fines zones.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">See Disposition of new Section 7B.06 regarding disposition of proposals in the NPA regarding higher fines zones.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, the S5-1 sign is renamed to “School Speed Limit When Flashing” to accurately match the legend of the sign.</p>

	<p>Also, FHWA proposes to revise existing Guidance P7 to recommend that the maximum beginning point of a reduced school speed limit zone in advance of school grounds is 500 feet. The recommendation was suggested by the NCUTCD and based on the results of research conducted on Speeds in School Zones (http://tti.tamu.edu/documents/0-5470-1.pdf).</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph to clarify that duplicate plaques for fines should be omitted if other traffic violations in addition to exceeding the speed limit are subject to higher fines based on Official Ruling No. 7(09)–3(I).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Several commenters opposed the proposed Guidance sentence recommending a maximum distance of 500 feet from the beginning point of a reduced school speed limit zone, suggesting Support language be used instead. The Guidance sentence is adopted with clarification that the 500 feet distance is in advance of the school grounds or a school crossing. The 500 feet maximum was based on research findings that longer school zones resulted in greater variability of speed within the zone. If there is a specific reason why a longer reduced school speed limit zone is necessary at a specific location, deviation can be based on engineering judgment.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Further, in response to comments “fixed message” is replaced with “static”, and “blank-out” is added for accuracy and completeness, and a reference to Chapter 2L is added. Based on the added reference to Chapter 2L the immediately following Option and Guidance paragraphs are removed, as they are not needed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In the first Option paragraph, the phrase “a combination of an END HIGHER FINES ZONE (R2-11) sign and” is deleted, for accuracy and consistency.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph about confirmation lights is removed because it is not a traffic control device and is not needed in Part 7.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Lastly, the paragraph about use of a Speed Limit Sign Beacon is changed from Option to Standard because if a speed limit sign or plaque with the legend WHEN FLASHING is used it is necessary to accompany it with a flashing yellow beacon that flashes during the times the school speed limit is in effect. The use of such and assembly is still optional, but this Standard clarifies that if a WHEN FLASHING plaque is used, the beacons are required.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In response to a comment, a Guidance paragraph is added to recommend that the Vehicle Speed Feedback plaque only be used during the time period when the school speed limit is in effect.</p>
