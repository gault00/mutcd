	<div class="npa">
	<p>257. In Section 2H.01 (existing Section 2H.02) retitled, “Scope,” FHWA proposes to add a Standard indicating there are circumstances where descriptive messages not relevant to navigation and orientation shall not be included in the legends of General Information signs. This clarification is needed to ensure that traffic control devices are employed only for their intended purpose of regulating, warning, and guiding road users.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section title and Standard are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise existing P3 to provide an exception for the color and shape of State Welcome signs, Acknowledgement signs, and Alternative Fuels Corridor signs, rather than jurisdictional boundary signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments indicating that recycling centers are still used in many communities, the Recycling Center (I4-2) symbol sign is retained and moved to Section 2H.01.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments, an Option statement allowing the use of a Passenger Ferry Only Terminal (I3-10) Sign with FERRY (I3-11P) plaque mounted below to provide directional information to passenger only ferry terminals is added.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to re-designate all signs in this Chapter to be consistent with the alphanumeric designations for all other signs in the Manual.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised sign designations are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>258. In Section 2H.02 (existing Section 2H.01) Sizes of General Information Signs, FHWA proposes to revise the Option allowing sign sizes to be larger than those contained in Table 2H–1 to add an exception that larger sizes may not be used where a maximum allowable size is specified.

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the Recycling Collection Center (I–11) symbol sign from the MUTCD because residential and curbside recycling make the need for this sign obsolete and separate Recycling Centers, apart from waste disposal facilities, generally do not exist anymore.</p>

Some commenters even stated these signs are neither necessary nor important. One commenter requested to increase the allowable timeframe the signs could be placed in advance of work commencing as the signs provide advance warning to travelers.

	<p>268. In Section 2H.12 (existing Section 2H.06), retitled,

FHWA proposes this addition to improve recognition of the sign message through the use of a consistent numbering nomenclature and provide consistency with the same requirement in Section 2H.10 for Reference Location Signs (D10–4) and Intermediate Reference Location Signs (D10–5).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard requiring a green background is adopted. One State requested that blue be retained as an Option for reference location signs located on ramps. FWHA does not believe there is a benefit in distinguishing ramps by color because the reference location signs on ramps would be distinguished by their legend, displaying the ramp name and/or directional description of the connected roadways. Their consistency in color would continue to make them identifiable as reference location signs for emergency reporting purposes.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to remove the sign design provisions for these signs as the designs are standardized and are required to comply with the existing provisions of Chapter 2A.</p>

This change is proposed to ensure these signs are consistent with other service type signs and maintain their purpose of acknowledging sponsors of services only.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard requiring Acknowledgment signs and plaques to have a white legend on blue background and specifying installation requirements is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add an Option allowing new Rest Area and Welcome Center Acknowledgement signs (I20–4 and I20–4a) that provides the name of the rest area and welcome center sponsor.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, editorial changes are made in the Option and subsequent Standard statement to clarify what is allowed on an Acknowledgment sign and requirements for sign placement. An additional Option statement is included allowing use of an additional Acknowledgment sign within the rest area.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes a new Standard prohibiting the names or representations of specific products or services provided by the sponsor within the rest area to be included on the sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted with a minor edit in terminology.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise the Standard paragraph regarding acknowledgment signs and plaque designs to include additional provisions related to orientation, dimension, area of the sign, and sizing the sign based on standard sizes specified in Table 2I–1. FHWA proposes these changes so that the MUTCD provisions for these signs are consistent with FHWA Order 5160.1A (https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/legsregs/ directives/orders/51601a.cfm) and sign size requirements established earlier in this Chapter.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The majority of the additional Standard items related to acknowledgment signs are adopted as proposed. In response to comments, the requirement in Item D related to horizontal orientation and ratio of width to height are removed to provide flexibility. In concert with this change, proposed Item I, also related to orientation and size, is removed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes an Option paragraph allowing for the name of the municipality or neighborhood in which the sponsoring outlet of a business is located if there are multiple locations in the same area. FHWA proposes this change to allow for the acknowledgment of the specific franchisee in cases in which the corporation itself is not the sponsor.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add an Option permitting Acknowledgement plaques to be mounted below General Service signs to acknowledge a sponsor of a corridor- or region- based highway related service including Radio-Weather Information (D12–1), Radio- Traffic Information (D12–1a), TRAVEL INFO CALL

	<div class="npa">
	<p>271. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2H.14 Alternative Fuels Corridor Sign” to provide Standard, Option, Guidance, and Support provisions for the use of Alternative Fuels Corridor signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Figures 2H–9 and 2H–10 to illustrate Alternative Fuels Corridor Sign Assembly examples and an Alternative Fuels Corridor Signing layout example, respectively. This section adds the provisions of FHWA policy memorandum entitled, “MUTCD—Signing for Designated Alternative Fuels Corridors," dated December 21, 2016 (https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/policy/alt_fuel_corridors/index.htm).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register notice for discussion of this item.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>In the NPA, FHWA proposed several revisions related to signing for electric vehicle (EV) charging and alternative fuels using General and Specific Service signs. General Service signs display words or symbols to eligible motorist services available along a freeway, expressway, or conventional road. Eligible services include food, gas, EV charging, lodging, camping, public telephone, hospital, or tourist information. Specific Service signs are display specific business identification logos of eligible of commercial motorist services available along a freeway or expressway. Business identification logos are grouped by eligible service category; eligible service categories for Specific Service signs are gas, EV charging, food, lodging, camping, and attractions. Both General Service and Specific Service signs used on freeways and expressways require trailblazing signs providing directional information from an exit ramp all the way to the service site when the service is not visible from the exit ramp intersection with the crossroad.</p>

	<p>Alternative Fuels Corridor signs inform road users of the highway segments that have been designated by FHWA as “Corridor Ready,” and use either General Service or Specific Service signs in advance of each interchange or intersection for the fuel service along that corridor. Eligible fuel services for Alternative Fuels Corridors are electric vehicle charging, compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquid propane gas, and hydrogen. The FHWA proposed to incorporate information related to EV charging and parking signing based on FHWA's Memorandum on Regulatory Signs for Electric Vehicle Charging and Parking Facilities. The FHWA also proposed to incorporate technical provisions based on FHWA's Policy Memorandum, “MUTCD-Signing for Designated Alternative Fuels Corridors,” issued December 21, 2016. The market for alternative fuel vehicles and specifically EVs has evolved significantly in recent years, as has the demand for such vehicles and their corresponding fueling/charging infrastructure. Comments on the NPA reflected this shift and focused on signing for EV charging services and Alternative Fuels Corridors by requesting additional flexibilities to include EV charging services on Specific Service Signs and EV charging supplemental messages on business identification (logo) sign panels for other types of services.</p>

	<p>The FHWA agrees with these comments and is adding several provisions to the MUTCD to ensure adequate flexibility is available to sign for EV charging services and Alternative Fuels Corridors. For Alternative Fuels Corridors, FHWA adds technical provisions from FHWA's Policy Memorandum, “MUTCD-Signing for Designated Alternative Fuels Corridors,” to the MUTCD in Chapter 2H, Section 2H.14. The provisions establish the Alternative Fuels Corridor signs in the MUTCD and clarify use of General Service Signs and directional assemblies to guide motorists to EV charging services. The final rule also includes new figures in MUTCD Section 2H.14 showing typical sign layouts along an Alternative Fuels Corridor and the use of EV charging General Service signs. As part of these changes, FHWA adds clarity in the final rule that directional trailblazing signing all the way to the charging service site is required when General Service signs are used.</p>

	<p>The FHWA also adds a new Specific Service sign category in Chapter 2J for EV charging. The existing general provisions for Specific Service signs apply equally to EV charging Specific Service signs. The eligibility to have an EV charging business identification sign panel on a sign generally reflects eligibility criteria for National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure funding and other types of fueling services. To reflect public comments, the final rule also allows EV charging supplemental messages be added to the bottom of a business identification sign panel used on other categories of Specific Service signs (food, lodging, etc.) if the EV charging service at that business meets the same eligibility criteria for the EV charging General Service signs. As with all Specific Service signs, directional signing from the freeway to the EV charging service is required if the direction to the site is unclear or additional guidance is needed such as when subsequent turns onto other roads are required.</p>
