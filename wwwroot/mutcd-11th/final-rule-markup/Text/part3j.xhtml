	<div class="npa">
	<p>380. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3J.07 Curb Extensions Designated by Pavement Markings” to include Support, Standard, Guidance, and Option paragraphs for the application of curb extension pavement markings. FHWA proposes these changes to improve consistency in the application of markings for curb extensions and uniformity when the application of pavement markings is to be used.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>In the NPA, FHWA also proposed to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3J.07 Curb Extensions Designated by Pavement Markings” to include Support, Standard, Guidance, and Option paragraphs to improve consistency and uniformity when the application of pavement markings is to be used to create an extension of the sidewalk in the roadway pavement. The term “curb extension” was used in the NPA to refer to roadway pavement that is reclaimed and designated for non-vehicular use. However, the term “sidewalk extension” is adopted in the final rule because it more accurately describes the purpose of the concept and emphasizes the redesignation of that portion of the roadway exclusively for pedestrian use. The term is also in established use in several design resources and, therefore, will enhance consistency. In some cases, after evaluating the site-specific context, it may be determined that redesignation of the area as a sidewalk extension, which reduces roadway crossing distances but places pedestrians closer to vehicular traffic, is not appropriate. A new Support statement is also adopted referencing the applicable sections for channelizing lines, edge lines, and diagonal markings, which can be used to modify the street or highway design (e.g., horizontal alignment, traveled-way width, sight distance, or similar) for speed management and channelizing, but the marked area is retained as part of the roadway rather than be redesignated as a pedestrian space.</p>

	<p>Several additional Guidance, Option, and Support paragraphs in Section 3J.07 that were proposed in the NPA are adopted with significant edits and clarifications in the final rule to provide context and considerations to improve vulnerable road user safety and provide accessibility, particularly for individuals with low visual acuity or other vision disabilities. While FHWA agrees that accessibility concerns should be considered for these areas, defining the conditions under which accessibility infrastructure is or is not required is beyond the scope of the MUTCD and would be covered either explicitly or implicitly under other regulations, such as accessibility standards that may be adopted by DOT or DOJ under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. In response to comments, and consistent with definitions contained within the MUTCD, an additional Standard is adopted in the final rule prohibiting the extension of crosswalk markings through sidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings, which would represent that the area is still part of the roadway, rather than an extension of the sidewalk. Extending the crosswalk markings through this area would be confusing to individuals with low visual acuity who rely on the crosswalk markings as one of the cues to confirm that they have left the sidewalk and entered the street where vehicular traffic is present. However, the proposed Guidance recommending that adequate provisions be made for pedestrians with disabilities through the sidewalk extension, between the physical curb ramp and the start of the crosswalk at the new edge of the traveled way as designated by the pavement marking, is not adopted as this is outside the scope of the MUTCD. In addition, the recommendation to use colored pavements in sidewalk extensions where pedestrian travel is expected is not adopted as this area is outside of the traveled way, and the details of the type of surface treatment used, if any, would not be subject to the provisions of the MUTCD except where it meets the pavement marking that defines the limits of the pavement open to vehicular travel. Accordingly, FHWA adopts a requirement that if aesthetic surface treatments are used in sidewalk extensions, they shall not be retroreflective as they are not traffic control devices.</p>

	<p>Comments were received that question the stipulation that the right-of-way is dedicated exclusively to highway-related functions, which undermines “placemaking” efforts. The proposed language was a reference to existing regulations that codify requirements related to the use of highway right-of-way. Notwithstanding, in response to comments, FHWA does not adopt the NPA proposed Guidance recommending that a policy for using aesthetic surface treatments in crosswalks should be considered if an agency determines that the use or design is appropriate for the right-of-way, since these treatments are adequately addressed in other provisions. Similarly, the Guidance recommending a speed limit threshold for which aesthetic crosswalk treatments should only be considered is not adopted. To ensure that the safety of road users remain the primary consideration, two additional Standards are adopted requiring that aesthetic surface treatments not interfere with traffic control devices, and that the colors used for aesthetic surface treatments not be standard traffic control device colors. The proposed Standard requiring aesthetic surface treatments not be of a surface that can confuse vision-impaired pedestrians that rely on tactile treatments or cues for navigation is adopted with editorial revision. Additional Guidance is also adopted in the final rule with recommendations to provide a gap between standard markings delineating areas and aesthetic surface treatments such that contrast is provided and the treatments do not interfere with traffic control devices. The proposed Standard prohibiting the use of advertising, pictographs, symbols, multiple color arrangements, and retroreflectivity in patterns that constitute a purely aesthetic surface treatment is revised with a prohibition on advertising and retroreflectivity retained in the Standard. Guidance is adopted to recommend against the use of pictographs and symbols with an additional recommendation not to use illusions. The proposed Support statements relating to materials for aesthetic surface treatments within the limits of crosswalks are also adopted with revision; specifically, paving materials such as setts or cobbles are removed, and Support is added relating to the surface of the crosswalk, the needs of pedestrians, and the requirements of the U.S. Department of Justice 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.</p>

	<p>Comments questioned the need for the Standard statement requiring aesthetic treatments to be designed such that they do not encourage road users to loiter or linger in the crosswalk, engage in the pattern, or otherwise not vacate the street in an expedient manner. The FHWA disagrees that the Standards and Guidance placing limitations on aesthetic treatments are unfounded as road user safety is the primary concern and visual distractions to vehicle operators in general are known to be a potential safety risk, especially to vulnerable road users. Many of the surface treatments that have been used are designed to draw the attention of road users to the treatment and, therefore, away from navigating the roadway environment. Thus, without adequate research data to determine the actual safety risk of different types of treatments, FHWA believes it is necessary to limit the use of surface treatments to ensure vulnerable road user safety. Where such treatments were being considered as a measure to improve pedestrian safety, FHWA believes the appropriate measure, instead, is to use one of the high-visibility crosswalk patterns, which are supported by research for visibility and conspicuity, strengthening the provisions for the protection of vulnerable users, consistent with section 11135 of BIL.</p>
