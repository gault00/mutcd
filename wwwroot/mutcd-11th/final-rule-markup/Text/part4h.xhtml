	<h3 id="section4H01">Section 4H.01 Use of Bicycle Signal Faces</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>417. FHWA proposes to add a new Chapter, numbered and titled, Chapter 4H Bicycle Signals, that includes provisions for the application, design, and operation of bicycle signals. This chapter contains twelve sections and provisions related to the use, warrants, application, size, placement, mounting height, intensity and light distribution, and yellow change and red clearance intervals for Bicycle Signal Faces. These sections and provisions are generally consistent with provisions for traffic control signals. A bicycle signal face consists of RED BICYCLE, YELLOW BICYCLE, and GREEN BICYCLE symbol signal indications that controls bicycle movements from a designated bicycle lane or from a separate facility, such as a shared use path. The proposed provisions are based on the Interim Approval 16 (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ ia16/index.htm) and multiple experimentations across the Country. One notable change from IAâ€“16 is the removal of the green arrow signal indication requirement when there are conflicts with motor vehicles moving concurrently from an adjacent lane. FHWA proposes this change to provide agencies with an option to control bikeways or bicycle lanes at signalized intersections.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Chapter 4H is generally adopted as proposed but with some revisions based on comments received. A few notable changes include relocating text from NPA proposed Section 9F.03 to this Chapter and adding a new Section for bicycle push buttons. See Preamble of Federal Register for additional discussion of use of bicycle signal faces at Pedestrian Hybrid Beacons.</p>
