	<h4>Traffic Control Signal Needs Study (Reexamine Signal Warrants and Changing Signal Warrants From Standard to Guidance)</h4>
	<p>In the NPA, FHWA proposed to change all paragraphs describing the application of the traffic signal warrant criterion to be considered in an engineering study for installing a new traffic control signal from Standard to Guidance. The FHWA proposed this change to provide agencies flexibility in performing signal warrant analyses.</p>

	<p>There were many comments for and against the change from Standard to Guidance. Commenters who supported the change agreed agencies would have more flexibility to consider “other factors” rather than the perceived heavy reliance placed on the numerical analysis. In their opinion, this leads to many agencies refusing to consider a traffic control signal in cases where a signal may be deemed beneficial, but the volume warrants are not met. Commenters who opposed the change were concerned with the cost impact associated with receiving pressure to install new signals where signals may not be appropriate. While not proposed in the NPA, FHWA received several comments stating that there is a need to rethink all traffic signal warrants believing them to be outdated and based on consensus rather than research. The FHWA notes that additional research is in progress through a National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) study  examining updates to the vehicular and pedestrian volume thresholds for traffic control signals, pedestrian hybrid beacons, and other pedestrian-actuated warning devices. In addition to pedestrian and vehicular volumes, the research is also examining latent pedestrian demand, land-use, and context to develop additional tools to assist in determining the appropriate traffic control device to improve safety for pedestrians. Following the issuance of this final rule, FHWA will explore opportunities for new research to reexamine the remaining signal warrants for potential updates and will consider research-based updates to a future revision to the MUTCD or through Interim Approval, as appropriate.</p>

	<p>The FHWA adopts the NPA proposed signal warrant language change from Standard to Guidance to reinforce that other factors, beyond the warrants, be considered as part of the engineering study to justify installation of traffic control signals. With this revision, agencies will have more flexibility to consider other relevant factors in addition to reliance on the numerical warrants analysis alone. While there is concern from some commenters who opposed the change that there could be increased costs associated with installing more traffic control signals and increased pressure to install new signals where they might not be appropriate, the adopted text provides agencies the necessary flexibility to consider all relevant factors in determining the need for a traffic control signal. The safe and efficient movement of all road users is the primary consideration in the engineering study to determine whether a traffic control signal should be installed rather than some other type of control or roadway configuration. Control by a traffic signal does not necessarily result in improved safety in every case. In some cases, a traffic signal at an inappropriate location could adversely impact safety for one or more road users. The purpose of the engineering study is to evaluate all relevant factors based on the specific location. The warrants are elements of the engineering study along with any other relevant factors. These additional considerations form the basis for conducting an engineering study and the results of the warrants analysis portion of the study is not intended to be the only or the overriding consideration. Agencies can, in fact, install a traffic control signal if a warrant is not met, but they are required to conduct the engineering study that demonstrates that the installation of a signal will improve the overall safety and/or operation of the intersection, which includes documentation of the rationale (i.e., the warrants analysis and consideration of other factors).</p>

    <h3 id="section4C01">Section 4C.01 Studies and Factors for Justifying Traffic Control Signals</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>389. In Section 4C.01 Studies and Factors for Justifying Traffic Control Signals, FHWA proposes to add an exception for temporary traffic signals to the Standard paragraph requiring an engineering study to justify a traffic control signal.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed but edited to clarify that the exemption is for the use of temporary traffic control signals as part of a temporary traffic control zone.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to clarify in Guidance P10 that if a minor street approach has an exclusive left turn lane, the approach should either be analyzed as a two-lane approach based on the sum of the traffic volumes using both lanes or as a one-lane approach based on only the traffic volume in the approach lane with the highest volume.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed with editorial revisions.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change P12 from Guidance to Option to allow agencies to determine whether a location with a wide median is considered as one or two intersections for a signal warrant analysis based on the site-specific conditions. FHWA proposes these changes to allow additional flexibility.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed and a reference to Section 2A.23 was added.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement referring to the alternatives to traffic control signals listed in Section 4B.05. FHWA proposes this change to reflect Official Change Request 4(09)–76(C) and to remind users of the Manual that there are several alternatives to traffic control signals.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, FHWA received comments regarding existing P07 that says a traffic control signal should not be installed if it will seriously disrupt progressive traffic flow. The commenters noted that the existing language prioritizes motor vehicle traffic and does not provide equal consideration of pedestrians. Based on these comments, this existing paragraph is deleted to encourage full consideration of all travel modes, especially vulnerable road users, not just vehicles.</p>

	<p>392. In Section 4C.05 Warrant 4, Pedestrian Volume, FHWA proposes to add an Option allowing the criteria to be applied separately to each direction of vehicular traffic where there is a divided street having a median of sufficient width for pedestrians to wait. This option is a variation of the second sentence of Item B in Paragraph 2 of Section 4C.05 in the 2003 MUTCD and is proposed by FHWA based on Official Ruling No. 4(09)–25(I) (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/ resources/interpretations/4_09_25.htm).

	<p>In Section 4C.08 Warrant 7, Crash Experience, FHWA proposed to revise Item B in Paragraph 2 to include updated signal warrant criteria for 1-year and 3-year periods, crash type, and severity, as well as major street speed and intersection location (urban vs. rural context).</p>

	<p>In conjunction with this change, FHWA proposed to add additional Support language regarding the critical minor-street volume, and a new Option paragraph that accompanies new tables related to criteria for considering traffic control signals in rural areas. The FHWA proposed these changes based on Interim Approval 19 and findings contained in NCHRP Project 07–18, “Crash Experience Warrant for Traffic Signals.” The research resulted in updated criteria, which is based on either 1 year or 3 years of recent crash experience, for the number of crashes portion of Warrant 7.</p>

	<p>Comments included a mixture of support and concern. Some commenters suggested that this approach is not consistent with Vision Zero and Safe System approaches in that it is reactive instead of proactive. For rural intersections, there also was concern the threshold for the number of crashes increased over the existing threshold in the 2009 MUTCD. Other commenters (primarily State DOTs) expressed concerns the lower thresholds for urban settings may result in the overuse of signals and disregard for using other safety alternatives at intersections. The commenters who supported the change appreciated that the values were updated based on research and noted that the various thresholds and tables provided engineers more flexibility to perform the signal warrant study.</p>

	<p>The FHWA adopts the revisions to Warrant 7 in the final rule. Based on comments received, FHWA adds an Option in the final rule allowing agencies to calibrate Highway Safety Manual safety performance functions (SPFs) to their own crash data or develop their own SPFs to produce agency specific average crash frequency values. When documented as part of the engineering study, these agency specific crash frequency values may be used instead of the values shown in Tables 4C–2 through 4C–5 when applying the Crash Experience signal warrant.</p>
