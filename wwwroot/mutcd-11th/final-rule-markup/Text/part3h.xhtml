	<p>365. In Section 3H.01 (existing Section 3G.01), retitled, “Standardization of Application,” FHWA proposes to add two new Standard paragraphs limiting the use of colored pavement only where it supplements other markings and prohibiting colors other than those specified in Chapter 3H (existing Chapter 3G) Colored Pavement. FHWA proposes this change to improve upon the previously established widespread system of uniformity in the application of colored pavement.

	<p class="fr-disp">Section 3H.01 titled “Standardization of Application” is adopted with revisions in response to comments and for consistency throughout Chapter 3H. In response to comments, existing P2 from existing Section 3G.01 which was proposed to be relocated to Section 3H.03 with edits, is moved to Section 3H.01 as to not change the meaning of the existing paragraph. Standard P2 and P3 are edited to clarify the use of colored pavement as a traffic control device.</p>

	<h4>Aesthetic Surface Treatments in Crosswalks, Islands, Medians, Shoulders, and Sidewalk Extensions</h4>
	<h5>General Discussion</h5>
	<p>In the NPA, FHWA proposed changes to address applications of colored pavements, making a distinction between the use of color in a traffic control device application (e.g., red-colored pavement for public transit systems, and green-colored pavement for bike lanes) versus as an aesthetic surface treatment that is not intended to serve a traffic control purpose. Commenters addressed a number of issues surrounding aesthetic surface treatments, often with disparate views. Along with those views expressed, commenters also generally acknowledged that there is a lack of research or safety data, positive or negative, to support the proposed provisions on aesthetic surface treatments; how individuals with vision disabilities are impacted by different surface treatments with varying colors or patterns; and concerns with machine vision and driving automation systems' ability to detect and process nonuniform aesthetic treatments. In this final rule, FHWA maintains the distinction between colored pavements that serve a traffic control purpose, and aesthetic surface treatments, whether colored or not, that are applied for aesthetic purposes only and are not intended to serve a traffic control purpose.</p>

	<p>The FHWA emphasizes that agencies that wish to employ surface treatments for aesthetic purposes in various scenarios have the flexibility to do so, as applicable Federal, State, and local laws and policies allow. However, the MUTCD does not prohibit the use of aesthetic surface treatments (including visually complex treatments, the designs of which might be characterized more as “artistic” in their composition), except in limited situations as described in more detail throughout this section. This includes the use of aesthetic surface treatments between the transverse lines within a crosswalk, in islands, in medians, in shoulders, within sidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings, or in other areas outside of the traveled way provided that the aesthetic surface treatment does not mimic, obscure, or otherwise adversely impact the effectiveness of other traffic control devices, such as other pavement markings in that location.</p>

	<p>Determination as to whether a surface treatment obscures or otherwise adversely impacts the traffic control devices is made by the State or local agency that owns and operates the roadway, taking into consideration any other Federal, State, or local laws, regulations, and policies governing the use of highway right-of-way unrelated to the MUTCD. The FHWA emphasizes that safety should be the top priority in making such determinations and, in many situations, the use of one of the high-visibility crosswalk patterns or the addition of other traffic control devices might instead be the appropriate measure to improve safety. New provisions are included in the final rule with the intent to provide agencies with information on reducing the likelihood of any aesthetic surface treatments compromising the effectiveness of traffic control devices by maintaining separation and contrast. The FHWA also adopts several provisions to help ensure that vulnerable road user safety is maintained, recognizing that agencies have the flexibility to make decisions taking into consideration a number of factors.</p>

	<p>Although aesthetic surface treatments most often involve the use of single or multiple colors, the MUTCD employs the term “colored pavement” to refer exclusively to traffic control devices as contrasted with aesthetic surface treatments that might incorporate color. Colored pavement for traffic control purposes is optional and supplements other standard markings. Specific color applications for traffic control purposes include green-colored bicycle lanes, purple-colored electronic toll lanes, red-colored transit lanes, white for channelizing, and yellow for median islands and channelizing. The provisions for aesthetic surface treatments are included within the Colored Pavements Chapter of the MUTCD to distinguish them from colored pavements that are traffic control devices, and to clarify how an aesthetic surface treatment might interact with a traffic control device so as not to adversely impact the effectiveness of the traffic control device.</p>

	<p>The new edition of the MUTCD only addresses those colored pavements that are traffic control devices, or those aesthetic surface treatments that interact with traffic control devices, as the scope of the MUTCD is limited to traffic control devices. Colored pavements used for traffic control purposes communicate regulations, guidance, and warnings to road users; supplement other standard markings with standard, solid color applications to pavement; and meet retroreflectivity criteria where applicable in accordance with the MUTCD.</p>

	<p>In contrast, surface treatments that are purely aesthetic do not include retroreflective elements; do not communicate regulations, guidance, warnings, or other information to road users; and do not interfere with or mimic traffic control devices. These aesthetic surface treatments are sometimes referred to as “street murals” or “asphalt art,” and might be a single solid color, or their designs might include multiple colors. Because these treatments are generally outside the scope of the MUTCD, the MUTCD does not prohibit them within the roadway right-of-way. Rather, as may be allowed by other Federal, State, or local statute, regulation, or policy, the determination of the acceptability of aesthetic surface treatments on street or highway right-of-way is determined by local or State authorities that have jurisdiction over the roadway. Therefore, the determination as to whether a particular aesthetic surface treatment is acceptable for use in the highway right-of-way falls outside the scope and provisions of the MUTCD except to the extent that the treatment might interfere with or mimic a traffic control device.</p>

	<h5>Continuing Research</h5>

	<p>Due to the interest in aesthetic surface treatments on travel pavements for over a decade, and the heightened interest in the more complex or artistic types of aesthetic surface applications in more recent years, in the NPA, FHWA requested comment on how more intricate designs and bright colors around standardized crosswalk markings improve the safety or operations at and around the crosswalk, while maintaining the recognition of the crosswalk. Jurisdictions often cite safety as the rationale for these types of installations. The FHWA requested that commenters support their position by providing quantifiable and objective data that they had collected or were aware of, such as from human factors evaluations or other studies. Specifically, FHWA sought information pertaining to the safety and navigation of road users, and any effects of non-standard designs on pedestrians with low visual acuity or other vision impairments. The FHWA also sought data on the ability of machine vision of driving automation systems to detect accurately and react appropriately to the markings as a crosswalk.</p>

	<p>Some commenters stated that, to their knowledge, aesthetically treated crosswalks do not contribute to a degradation of road user safety; however, substantive quantifiable and objective data to support this position were not provided. Some commenters suggested that additional research be conducted to formulate appropriate regulations consisting of appropriate applications, designs, and materials before moving forward.</p>

	<p>As mentioned earlier, FHWA has been aware that this area is of interest for communities and, in response to longstanding concerns, is conducting research on the safety implications of various types of surface treatments in crosswalks. The FHWA will use the results to inform potential changes to the MUTCD and/or the need for additional research into vulnerable road user safety at crosswalks.</p>

	<p>The FHWA is also aware of a study conducted on the potential safety effects of “asphalt art” which was published after the NPA docket closed. The study report concludes that there is a correlation between asphalt art and improved safety, though it could not establish or infer causation, in part due to the confounding of a number of variables including other improvements made concurrently, and the inability to determine whether the art itself, additional traffic control, roadway, or roadside improvements resulted in the improvement. For example, it is generally accepted that a narrowing of the street or traveled way, such as with pavement markings to create sidewalk extensions or channelization, can reduce vehicle operating speeds. The extent to which the addition of aesthetic treatments within the reclaimed pavement at many of the study sites either contributed to, or inhibited, an improvement in safety could not be determined or was not reported. For this reason and, as stated in the study, to determine whether surface treatments individually contribute to vulnerable road user safety, FHWA is conducting research.</p>

	<p>In addition, in response to comments, FHWA will continue to gather more data on the use of colored pavements that are part of traffic control markings to learn more about their overall safety impacts, with a particular focus on people with disabilities, including those with low visual acuity or cognitive impairments. The FHWA is in the process of completing closed-course research on the impacts of a subset of surface treatments in crosswalks consisting of brick patterns, multiple color arrangements, or more complex geometric designs using multiple colors in combination with different underlying standard crosswalk patterns. This research specifically includes pedestrians with low vision as research participants, in addition to pedestrians and drivers. The FHWA is pursuing additional open-course research to support the closed-course research. Upon statistically significant research results or measures of effectiveness from additional open-course studies suggesting there is a direct impact on vulnerable road user safety, further updates to the regulations surrounding surface treatments, beyond those updates included in this rule, might be considered in a future rulemaking effort. Similarly, this issue may be revisited based on the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board's (U.S. Access Board) Accessibility Guidelines for Pedestrian Facilities in the Public Right-of-Way (“PROWAG”) rulemaking  and other research into tactile wayfinding in transportation environments, particularly when considering crosswalks and sidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings.</p>

	<h5>Colored Pavement as a Traffic Control Device</h5>

	<p>In Section 3H.01 (existing Section 3G.01), retitled, “Standardization of Application,” FHWA adopts a new Standard paragraph limiting the use of colored pavement as a traffic control device only to where it supplements other markings. The FHWA adopts this change to improve upon the established widespread system of uniformity in the application of colored pavement used as a traffic control device. This requirement does not apply to colored pavements used as a purely aesthetic surface treatment. The proposed Standard regarding the colors to be used for colored pavement is not adopted, as an existing Standard paragraph in this Section already contains these requirements as they apply to colored pavements used as a traffic control device.</p>

	<p>The FHWA adopts a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3H.02 Materials,” to provide agencies with information to assist in the selection of appropriate colored pavement materials to improve road user safety. This section is adopted with revisions in response to comments; however, the proposed Support paragraph regarding wear of colored pavement is not adopted in the final rule, since it is not related to the use of a traffic control device, and the maintenance of traffic control devices is covered in other sections. Some commenters requested additional specific information on appropriate skid resistance values considering all road users. Historically, standard specifications for construction, including colored pavement or pavement marking material specifications containing specific skid resistance values or coefficients of friction, are developed by the individual State and local agencies based on their specific needs. As a minimum skid resistance value may have an impact on vulnerable road user safety, FHWA will review available research and information to inform potential future changes to the MUTCD or to another resource as appropriate.</p>

	<h4>Aesthetic Surface Treatments—Interaction With Traffic Control Devices</h4>

	<p>The FHWA proposed to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3H.03 Aesthetic Treatments in Crosswalks,” with two paragraphs from existing Section 3G.01 and new Standard, Guidance, Option, and Support to reflect FHWA's Official Ruling No. 3(09)-24 (I) which was issued in response to a trend by some agencies toward installing treatments on roadway pavement that go beyond the basic aesthetics of the paving materials and instead include bright colors, visually complex graphics, images, or words. Some commenters supported the proposed changes noting the specific needs of people with low visual acuity or other vision impairments, along with the limited abilities of machine vision, to discern variations in surface treatments from standard markings. Other commenters stated that there is no evidence that suggests adverse impacts from these treatments on roadways with a posted speed limit above 30 mph. Many comments also indicated a lack of research that suggests surface treatments in general create safety concerns, and the proposed Standards are unfounded. Other commenters suggested that any regulation of aesthetic surface treatments is inappropriate in the MUTCD as they are not traffic control devices.</p>

	<p>While FHWA agrees that aesthetic surface treatments are not traffic control devices, FHWA believes that this proposed section is appropriate because of the interaction with official traffic control devices that such treatments frequently pose. As stated earlier, it is important that these treatments not resemble or interfere with the uniform appearance of traffic control devices, as that could confuse and distract road users. In response to comments, FHWA limits the Standards, Guidance, and Support included in the MUTCD regarding aesthetic surface treatments to those provisions that are necessary to help ensure pedestrian safety and the accessibility of individuals with disabilities, and to minimize any adverse impacts to the effectiveness of traffic control devices. As described earlier, the MUTCD does not prohibit the application of aesthetic surface treatments within the roadway. However, the MUTCD does limit their use or character to the extent that they interact with or relate to traffic control devices. In addition, the use of these treatments could be subject to other Federal, State, or local regulations and policies unrelated to the MUTCD. Those other regulations or policies might prohibit or otherwise limit the use of aesthetic surface treatments in some situations. In other words, aesthetic surface treatments are not of themselves prohibited by the MUTCD, but the MUTCD limits how the treatments might overshadow the nature of traffic control devices such as marked crosswalks. Transportation agencies implement aesthetic treatments at their own risk as permissible by local, State, and other Federal laws, regulations, and policies; as long as the treatments do not interfere with, confuse, or obstruct traffic control devices for any users, especially people with disabilities, including those with low visual acuity; and, ultimately, subject to an overall assessment of road user safety.</p>

	<h4>Aesthetic Surface Treatments—Maintaining Separation and Contrast</h4>

	<p>The FHWA adopts the newly proposed Section with a revised title, “3H.03 Aesthetic Surface Treatments” in response to comments that questioned the perceived restrictions by lack of specific language on aesthetic surface treatments at other locations such as islands, medians, shoulders, sidewalk extensions designated by pavement markings, or other areas outside the traveled way. New provisions are included in the final rule with the intent to provide agencies information on how to prevent aesthetic surface treatments from compromising the effectiveness of traffic control devices by maintaining separation and contrast. Existing Support Paragraph 2 from existing Section 3G.01, is relocated to Section 3H.01 with edits, and additional revisions are made to the final rule in Sections 3H.01, 3J.03 and 3J.07 to clarify the difference between colored pavements used as traffic control devices and aesthetic surface treatments, and the considerations in the use of aesthetic surface treatments.</p>

	<h3 id="section3H03">Section 3H.03 Aesthetic Treatments in Crosswalks</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>367. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3H.03 Aesthetic Treatments in Crosswalks,” with P2 and P6 from existing Section 3G.01 and to add new Standard, Guidance, Option, and Support paragraphs describing appropriate use of aesthetic treatments within crosswalks and to provide examples of acceptable materials and patterns.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Figure 3H–1 to illustrate examples of acceptable materials for interior portions of crosswalks. FHWA proposes these changes to reflect FHWA’s Official Ruling No.
3(09)-24(I) (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/ interpretations/3_09_24.htm), which was issued in response to a trend by some agencies toward
installing aesthetic treatments on roadway pavement
that include bright colors, visually complex graphics, images, or words. FHWA believes that this proposed section is necessary because it is important that these treatments not resemble or interfere with the uniform appearance of traffic control devices, which could confuse and distract road users.
</p>

	<p>FHWA’s longstanding position is that these treatments, which are intended to draw the attention of the road user, can distract from the task of operating a vehicle or crossing the roadway as a pedestrian, and that many of the goals of an agency installing these treatments can be accomplished through other means that do not alter or compromise the uniform appearance of traffic control devices.</p>

	<p>Based on the varying views that the public has expressed on this topic, FHWA requests that commenters provide sufficient detail and explanation of how their position would maintain the uniformity and recognition of crosswalk markings.</p>

	<p>Since these types of aesthetic treatments oftentimes are installed with the stated purpose of improving safety (in addition to establishing community identity or for “placemaking” purposes), FHWA requests comment on how allowing more intricate designs and bright colors around standardized crosswalk markings improves the safety or operations at and around the crosswalk, while maintaining the recognition of the crosswalk.</p>

	<p>FHWA requests that commenters support their position by providing quantifiable and objective data, such as from human factors evaluations, about the safety and operation of vehicular and street traffic, safety and navigation of pedestrians, any assessments of the effects of nonstandard designs on pedestrians with low visual acuity or other vision impairments, and the ability of machine vision of autonomous vehicles to detect accurately and react appropriately to the markings as a crosswalk or, if not installed with a crosswalk, other type of marking.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>370. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3H.06 Green-Colored Pavement for Bicycle Facilities” to include Standard paragraphs establishing the use of green colored pavement for a variety of bicycle facilities and prohibiting its use on shared-use paths, shared-lane markings, crosswalks, and on separated bicycle lanes on an independent alignment.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3H.06 Green-Colored Pavement for Bicycle Facilities is adopted with modifications based on comments received and in conformance with the language include in Interim Approval 14.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Additional Guidance is adopted to recommend limiting the application of green-colored pavement on separated bicycle lanes on an independent alignment only to the entrances to the separated facility or at conflict, weaving, or crossing locations. Another Guidance paragraph is adopted to recommend limiting the application of green-colored pavement on shared use paths to only those locations where different travel modes (e.g. bicyclists and pedestrians) are separated, rather than shared. The addition of these Guidance paragraphs aims to provide flexibility to utilize increased conspicuity of bicycle facilities where appropriate, while also ensuring colored pavement is not overused which may dimmish its efficacy overall.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Option paragraphs stating where green-colored pavement may be applied and Guidance recommending installation of regulatory and guide signing with green-colored pavement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Option and Guidance are adopted as proposed with minor clarifying changes and additions.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Standard sentence requiring the pattern of green-colored pavement to match the pattern of dotted lines is adopted in the final rule. As green-colored pavement supplements other required markings it is appropriate to consistently match the marking patterns used.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to provide a new Figure 3H-4 and revise Figures in Part 9 to illustrate examples of green colored pavement. FHWA proposes these changes based on Interim Approval
No. 14 and Official Ruling #9(09)-86 (I) on Chromaticity Requirements	for	Green-Colored Pavement (<a href="http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia14/index.htm">http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia14/index.htm</a>).</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>371. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3H.07 Red-Colored Pavement for Public Transit Systems” to include Standard paragraphs establishing the use of red colored pavement for lanes where general purpose traffic is not allowed and requiring regulatory signs establishing the allowable use of the lane.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This section is adopted with several revisions. Taxis are excluded from the list of public transit vehicles since they are generally not considered as such.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Option paragraphs stating where red-colored pavement can be applied and a Guidance paragraph recommending red colored pavement not be used on public transit facilities separated from the roadway or on exclusive alignments.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, the use of red-colored pavement may be determined by engineering judgement, rather than engineering study to allow more flexibility, and the expected result of the use of red-colored pavement is to improve transit reliability and reduce overall travel time.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to provide a new Figure 3H–5 to illustrate an example of the use of red- colored pavement. FHWA proposes these changes based on Interim Approval 22 (<a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia22/index.htm">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot. gov/resources/interim_approval/ia22/index.htm</a>) and the results of multiple experimentations across the country, including in the following jurisdictions: City of Chicago, IL; the City of New York, NY; the District of Columbia; the City of Santa Rosa, CA; and San Diego County, CA.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Comments	requested the proposed Standard paragraph be revised to Guidance as there may be reasons for exceptions where general-purpose traffic is intended to be precluded. The proposed Option statements intend to provide those exceptions and the proposed Standard is adopted as proposed. Figure 3H-5 is adopted with minor revisions.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>372. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3H.08 Purple-Colored Pavement for Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Account-Only Preferential Lanes” to include Standard paragraphs limiting use of purple-colored pavement to lanes approaching toll plazas that are restricted to registered ETC accounts and lanes approaching an Open Road Tolling (ORT) collection facility and prohibiting its use on an approach that also facilitates other payment methods downstream.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3H.08 is adopted with new Standards and Option as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Standard paragraphs regarding the use of longitudinal and edge lines to flank the purple-colored pavement.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes an Option paragraph allowing its use for the entire length of the toll lane or ORT collection facility or for only a portion (or portions).</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to provide a new Figure 3H-6 to illustrate an example of the use of purple- colored pavement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Figure 3H-6 is adopted with minor revisions for consistency.</p>
