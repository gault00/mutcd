	<p>321. In Section 3B.01, retitled, “Yellow Center Line Pavement Markings,” FHWA proposes revising P6 to specify that reversible lanes and two-way left turn lanes are exceptions to the requirement for two normal solid yellow lines for undivided roadways with four or more lanes. The proposed provisions explicitly state exceptions that are currently implied in existing Section 3B.03.</p>

	<p>323. In Section 3B.03 (existing Section 3B.02), retitled, “No-Passing Zone Pavement Markings,” FHWA proposes to change the second and third sentences in existing P4 from Standard to Support because they contain design information and not traffic control device requirements and are supported by an NCHRP research report (<a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/23278/passing-sight-distance-criteria">http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/nchrp/nchrp_rpt_605.pdf</a>).

	<p class="fr-disp">Changing the second and third sentences in P4 of Section 3B.03 from Standard to Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Changing existing P9 of Section 3B.03 from Option to
Support is adopted as proposed.
</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes deleting existing P14– P16 since they are redundant with existing provisions contained in Section 3B.12 (existing Section 3B.09).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Existing P14 through P16 in Section 3B.03 are deleted as proposed.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>326. In Section 3B.06 (existing Section 3B.04), retitled, “White Lane Line Pavement Markings,” FHWA proposes to expand existing P25 by changing existing P26 from Option to Guidance to recommend, rather than just allow, solid white lane lines on approaches to intersections to separate adjacent mandatory turn lanes, and to add a recommended use of solid white lane lines at toll collection points to separate toll lanes, payment methods, channelized movements, or obstructions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing P26 in existing Section 3B.04 from Option to Guidance is adopted in Section 3B.06 as proposed. In addition, Guidance regarding solid line markings at toll collection points is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option paragraph allowing solid white lane lines to separate contiguous through traffic lanes on an approach to an intersection, to separate through traffic lanes from auxiliary lanes, and on approaches to crosswalks across multilane roadways, reflecting a common current practice.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Options in Section 3B.06 for solid lane line markings are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add new Option and Support paragraphs for providing curved transitions where an edge line, channelizing line, or dotted extension line changes direction. FHWA proposes this change based on the recognition that many agencies currently use curved, rather than angular, transitions for changes in direction.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Options in Section 3B.06 for curved transitions are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<h3 id="section3B07">Section 3B.07 White Lane Line Markings for Non-Continuing Lines</h3>
	</span>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>327. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3B.07 White Lane Line Markings for Non- Continuing Lanes” consisting of P6–P19, and P23 of existing Section 3B.04.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3B.07 White Lane Line Markings for Non-Continuing Lanes is adopted with a few revisions.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise existing Standard P13 to add a new Item C requiring a wide dotted white lane line in advance of freeway route splits with an option lane. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistency with existing requirements for similar situations in which traffic in one of the lanes must depart from the main route.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Item C under the wide dotted white lane line Standard in Section 3B.07 is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to add Drawing E showing an example of a route split with option lane to Figure 3B–10 Examples of Applications of Freeway and Expressway Lane-Drop Markings.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The figure is adopted as Figure 3B-11, and Drawing E is adopted with revisions. The additional sheets in the figure are adopted with revisions for consistency with the provisions.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change two Options to Standards requiring dotted white line extensions for deceleration lanes at exit ramps and for acceleration lanes at entrance ramps based on recommendations from the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices’ (NCUTCD) CAV Task Force and NCHRP 20–102(06) (<a href="https://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=4004">https://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=4004</a>).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing the Option in Section 3B.07 pertaining to dotted white line extensions for deceleration lanes to Standard is adopted as proposed. Duplicate text is removed in the final rule. However, changing the Option in Section 3B.07, pertaining to dotted white line extensions for acceleration lanes, to Standard is not adopted, and is retained as an Option. Comments were received related to the potential for drivers not to merge due to the white line extensions, and additional research is required.</p>

	<p>328. In Section 3B.08 (existing Section 3B.05), retitled, “Channelizing Lines,” FHWA proposes to change existing P2 from Option to Support because the information about channelizing lines provides general information and does not provide an option.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing existing P2 from Option to Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add two new Standard paragraphs requiring channelizing lines on both sides of the neutral area for bifurcations created from open- road tolling lanes that bypass a conventional toll plaza and on both sides of the neutral area formed at access and egress points to and from a managed- lane facility. FHWA proposes this change to guide road users around the neutral area either to general purpose lanes or the tolling and/or managed lanes.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standards in Section 3B.08 pertaining to channelizing lines are adopted with minor editorial changes.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA also proposes to modify existing P3 to change “channelizing lines” to “neutral area” regarding the requirement that other markings in the area be white.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing existing P3 from “channelizing lines” to
“neutral area” is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes new Support listing chevron markings, retroreflective raised pavement markers, and internally illuminated raised pavement markers as items within the neutral area, with section references.</p>

	<p>329. In Section 3B.09 (existing Section 3B.06), FHWA proposes to add a Guidance recommending that edge lines on two-lane roadways should be at least 6 inches wide, regardless of the width of the normal line used on the roadway.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>330. In Section 3B.11 (existing Section 3B.08), retitled, “Application of Pavement Markings Through Intersections or Interchanges,” FHWA proposes to change part of P1 requiring that pavement markings extended into or continued through an intersection or interchange be the same width from Standard to Guidance. FHWA proposes this change because the combination of the provision with the existing Option in P2 is more appropriate as Guidance and the application can be determined using engineering judgment.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing a portion of P1 in Section 3B.11 from
Standard to Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to relocate to this section an existing Standard requiring that extensions of center lines through intersections, if used, shall be dotted lines. This Standard is an existing requirement contained only in a Note on existing Figure 3B–13 (D) Examples of Lane Extensions through Intersections. This Note is proposed for deletion from the figure to avoid duplication.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard requiring that extension lines through intersections be dotted lines is relocated to Section 3B.11 as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to relocate P2 from Section 3B.09 (existing Section 3B.06) and change from Standard to Guidance for restricting the use of edge line extensions through intersections.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing P2 from Section 3B.06 from Standard to Guidance and relocating to Section 3B.11 is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to relocate and revise P5 from Section 3B.09 (existing Section 3B.06) for maintaining edge lines at driveways that do not meet the definition of an intersection. FHWA proposes the relocations to consolidate provisions regarding markings through intersections.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">P5 from Section 3B.06 is relocated to Section 3B.11 as proposed.</p>

	<p>Also, FHWA proposes to modify Standard P6 to provide an exception to allow solid lines to extend edge lines through intersections or major driveway when there is no intersecting approach. FHWA proposes this change based on feedback from designers so markings will send intended effect and not communicate a conflict where none exists, and to provide additional user flexibility for situations like the top of a T-intersection when the prohibition of solid lines through the intersection is not applicable.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standard P6 is adopted with an edit to provide an exception for solid lines to extend edge lines through intersections where there is no intersecting approach, such as at the far side of a T-intersection.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph recommending that solid lines not be used to extend edge lines into or through intersections or major driveways except through that part of the intersection with no intersecting approach (such as at the top of a T-intersection). FHWA proposes this change to provide drivers a visual cue of side street traffic.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new paragraph is adopted as a Standard, with an exception incorporated into it, as discussed in the previous disposition.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">To reduce potential confusion with merging vehicles, an Option is added in the final rule to allow dotted edge line extensions through intersections.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to delete existing Guidance P8 because the information is related to design and not traffic control device uniformity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance P8 is deleted as proposed.</p>

	<p>331. In Section 3B.12 (existing Section 3B.09), retitled, “Lane-Reduction Transitions,” FHWA proposes to revise the Standard P3 to state the criteria for lane- reduction transitions more clearly, rather than referring to the Figure, which contains elements that are required, recommended, and optional.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Standard is adopted as proposed in Section 3B.12 to clearly state the criteria for lane- reduction transitions.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph and list for recommended markings for lane-reduction transitions, comprising information throughout the Section and contained in existing Figure 3B–14.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance for lane-reduction transitions is adopted with minor editorial revisions.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete all the notes in Figure 3B–14 and retitle it to “Examples of Applications of Lane Reduction Transitions.”</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Notes are deleted from Figure 3B-14 with the exception of the definition of “L” as the length of taper in feet, “W” as the offset in feet, and “AP” as the advance placement distance, and the title is revised as proposed. A note referencing Section 2C.47 for information about the signs shown in the figure was added.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a new Option paragraph permitting the minimum taper length to be less than 100 feet on roadways where operating speed is less than 25 mph based on common practice and to provide practitioner flexibility on low-speed roadways.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">An additional Option is adopted which allows the use of a dotted white line between the point the broken white lane line is terminated to the point where the transition taper begins.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>340. In Section 3B.25 (existing Section 3B.24), retitled, “Chevron and Diagonal Markings,” FHWA proposes to delete the term “crosshatch” and instead just use the words “chevron” and “diagonal” to describe the marking better and provide more situations where each can be used.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The term “crosshatch” in Section 3B.25 is removed as proposed, with the terms “chevron” or “diagonal” used instead. The final rule includes several edits suggested by commenters that clarify the use of chevron and diagonal markings.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change the existing Option paragraph into separate Guidance paragraphs for chevron and diagonal markings to recommend the intended applications for each. FHWA based this on the NCUTCD CAV Task Force and Automated Driving Systems Task Force joint recommendations that were approved by the Markings Technical Committee in June 2019.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, changing the Option to Guidance is not adopted and the Option is retained in the final rule.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph recommending white markings for diagonal markings used in on-street no-parking zones and a new Option to allow lines used for diagonal markings in no-parking zones to be 4 inches wide.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new Guidance is not adopted. Instead, the Standard requiring white is revised to specifically include no-parking zones. The proposed Option paragraph is adopted with edits to clarify that 4” wide diagonal markings may be used in no-parking zones or on roadways with operating speeds of less than 25 mph.</p>

	<p>Further, FHWA proposes to modify a Guidance paragraph to recommend that the lines used for chevron and diagonal markings to be at least 4 inches wide on roadways where the operating speed is less than 25 mph to provide practitioner flexibility on low- speed roadways.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted with revisions and the allowance for 4” wide markings is changed to an Option in response to comments.</p>

The new information contains proposed Standards for edge lines, lane use arrows, and wrong-way arrows as well as a restriction for flush median islands.
