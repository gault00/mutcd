	<div class="npa">
	<p>403. In Section 4E.01 (existing Section 4D.06) Signal Indications—Design, Illumination, Color, and Shape, FHWA proposes to revise P9 to require that displays meet the minimum requirements of “Equipment and Materials Standards of the Institute of Transportation Engineers” for signal optical units that use incandescent lamps within optical assemblies that include lenses.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add the requirements of the publications entitled, “Vehicle Traffic Control Signal Heads: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Circular Signal Supplement” and “Vehicle Traffic Control Signal Heads: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Vehicle Arrow Traffic Signal Supplement” that pertain to the aspects of the signal head design that affect the display of the signal indications shall be met for light emitting diode (LED) traffic signal modules, except during nighttime conditions, which is addressed in the revised paragraph 11. FHWA proposes this change based on Official Ruling No. 4(09)–28(I) (https://mutcd.fhwa.dot. gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_28.htm).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to change P11 from Standard to Support and combine with P12 because it contains general information about signal lenses and is not a requirement for traffic control signals.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">FHWA received comments that noted concerns regarding the proposed NPA deletion of the exception for preemption confirmation lights in P4. Based on these comments, the proposed deletion is not adopted and the exception for emergency vehicle preemption indications is retained.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">FHWA also received comments that noted concerns with the bimodal signal section that alternatively displays a GREEN ARROW and YELLOW ARROW due to colorblind drivers not being able to distinguish between the colors. Based on these comments, the Standard is changed to an Option to continue to permit this bimodal signal section but encourage the use of the bimodal signal section that has the steady YELLOW ARROW and flashing YELLOW ARROW based on research that showed better driver comprehension.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>404. In Section 4E.02 (existing Section 4D.07) Size of Vehicular Signal Indications, FHWA proposes to require all arrow signal indications to be twelve-inch to enhance safety and conspicuity of the arrow legend.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">
The change is adopted as proposed.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to modify the existing Option to allow 8-inch circular indications in a flashing beacon based on Official Ruling No. 4(09)–7(I) (http://mutcd. fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_7.htm).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Option allowing the use of different sizes of signal indications in the same face or signal head. This option is a variation of P5 of Section 4D.15 in the 2003 MUTCD. Even though this was implied in the 2009 MUTCD, this new Option would provide agencies explicit flexibility to install twelve-inch arrows with eight-inch circular displays if the conditions permit eight-inch circular displays.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, FHWA received comments that noted P1 did not include four-inch signal indications as proposed in Chapter 4H. Based on these comments and for consistency, P1 is revised to include four-inch signal indications and also adds a new Standard limiting the use of four-inch signal indications only to bicycle signal faces.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Further, Item F in P4 is deleted, since circular indications are no longer permitted for signal faces controlling bicycle movements with the addition of the bicycle signal faces with bicycle symbol indications.</p>
