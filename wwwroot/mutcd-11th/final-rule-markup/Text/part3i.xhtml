	<div class="npa">
	<p>373. In Section 3I.01 (existing Section 3H.01) Channelizing Devices, FHWA proposes to add an Option paragraph to clarify that orange-colored channelizing devices are allowed to emphasize pavement markings outside of temporary traffic control zones, as long as the devices are not permanent.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3I.01 Channelizing Devices is adopted with the new Option and Support as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add this Option to facilitate use of channelizing devices in emergency incidents and planned special events, because it is usually not practical for police officers or other authorized personnel to obtain and deploy channelizing devices that match the color of the existing pavement markings.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete P5 since this information is related to maintenance and not related to traffic control device uniformity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Existing Guidance regarding maintenance is deleted as proposed.</p>

	<p>374. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3I.02 Tubular Markers” to include Standard, Guidance, and Option paragraphs to provide size requirements and recommended spacing.

	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3I.02 Tubular Markers is adopted with minor revisions. The requirement that tubular markers shall be made with a material that can be struck without causing damage to a vehicle is not adopted, since it is ambiguous.</p>
