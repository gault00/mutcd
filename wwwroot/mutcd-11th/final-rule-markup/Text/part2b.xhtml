    <h1>Chapter 2B. Regulatory Signs, Barricades, and Gates</h1>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>46. As part of the reorganization to improve usability of the MUTCD, FHWA proposes to include subchapter headings in Chapter 2B to organize sections into related groupings. FHWA proposes the following subchapters in Chapter 2B: General; Signing for Right-of-Way at Intersections; Speed Limit Signs and Plaques; Movement and Lane Control Signs; Passing Keep Right and Slow Traffic Signs; Selective Exclusion Signs; Do Not Enter, Wrong Way; One- Way and Related Signs and Plaques; Parking, Standing, Stopping, and Emergency Signs; Pedestrian Signs; Traffic Signal Signs; Road Closed and Weight Limit Signs; Other Regulatory Signs, and Barricades and Gates.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The reorganization of Chapter 2B with sub-chapter headings is adopted as proposed.</p>
	</div>

    <h3 id="section2B01">Section 2B.01 Application of Regulatory Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>47. In Section 2B.01 Application of Regulatory Signs, FHWA proposes to delete portions of existing Standard P3 and all of P4 requiring signs to be the same shape and similar color by day and by night and restricting street lighting use for sign illumination, because the information is repetitive and covered elsewhere in the Manual.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The text deletions of portions of P3 and P4 are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment recommending addition of a Support statement about regulatory signing on low-volume rural roads is not adopted, as the subject is adequately covered in Section 2A.02.</p>

	</span>

    <h3 id="section2B02">Section 2B.02 Design of Regulatory Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>In Section 2B.02 Design of Regulatory Signs, FHWA proposes to delete existing Option P2 and P3 because they are already covered in existing Section 2A.06.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletions of existing P2 and P3 are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise P5 from Guidance to Standard.   FHWA also proposes to apply the Standard to LED signs for a part-time message and indicate the color scheme of regulatory messages displayed with LEDs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revision of existing P5 to Standard is adopted with further clarifications as well as the removal of the black symbol on a full matrix white LED background consistent with the provisions of Chapter 2L.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA also proposes adding an Option and two Standard paragraphs pertaining to the use of LEDs in the border of a sign and the display of regulatory signs in a full matrix changeable message sign, respectively. FHWA proposes these changes to provide uniformity in the application LEDs in traffic control signs and changeable message signs. These changes are necessary to ensure a consistent appearance in the sign legend regardless of the type of display, whether static, illuminated, or changeable.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed added Option regarding use of LEDs is revised to a Support statement referring to Section 2A.12, to be consistent with Chapter 2C, and the added Standard regarding display of regulatory signs in a full matrix CMS, are both adopted as proposed.  The Standard paragraph prohibiting use of blank-out signs for Stop or Yield signs is relocated to Sections 2B.04 and 2B.05, respectively, as those locations are more appropriate.</p>

    <h3 id="section2B03">Section 2B.03 Size of Regulatory Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>49. In Section 2B.03 Size of Regulatory Signs, FHWA proposes to add a Standard statement regarding the size of regulatory signs on low-volume roads with operating speeds of 30 mph or less, to capture the language provided in the existing Part 5 text that has been redistributed among the remaining parts.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete P6, requiring the use of 36″ x 36″ STOP signs on multi-lane approaches, because that requirement already exists in existing P3 and Table 2B–1. FHWA also proposes to delete P7 and P8 requiring the use of 36″ x 36″ STOP signs on side roads that intersect with multi-lane streets of
45 mph or higher speed limits, even if the side road is not multi-lane, because this may place an undue burden on agencies to change existing 30″x 30″ signs at such locations. FHWA proposes to revise existing Guidance P9 and add a new Guidance paragraph to allow the use of single lane or multi-lane conventional road sign sizes on ramps that connect expressways or freeways to intersections with a conventional roadway. FHWA proposes this change, because the operating characteristics of exit ramps connecting expressways or freeways to other expressways or freeways are different from those connecting expressways or freeways to conventional roads. As a result, signs on exit ramps connecting to conventional roads do not require the larger size signs associated with a freeway or an expressway.
</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add a Standard requiring the use of a near side NO TURN ON RED or RIGHT (LEFT) ON RED ARROW AFTER STOP sign, as applicable, to supplement a far side, single-lane sized R10–11, R10–11a, R10–11b, or R10–17a sign when the distance between the stop line and the far side sign is more than 120 feet. FHWA proposes this to provide additional signing for turning vehicles at the near side of the intersection to supplement the far side sign at an increased distance.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed added Standard is relocated to Section 2B.60 because that is where design and placement of NO TURN ON RED signs is discussed. Also, the proposed added Option to allow the single- lane column sizes to be used on a multi-lane approach for certain NO TURN ON RED signs is not adopted, because the single-lane and multilane sizes for these signs are identical.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting addition of an Option allowing smaller sizes for most signs on site roadways open to public travel with speeds less than 25 mph is not adopted in this section but is addressed by a Standard in Section 2A.07.</p>

FHWA proposes to delete existing Sections 2B.04 (Right-of-Way at Intersections), 2B.06 (STOP Sign Applications), 2B.07 (Multi-Way Stop Applications), and 2B.09 (YIELD Sign Applications) and replace them with new Sections 2B.06 through 2B.18, as described below, to address comprehensively the need for warrants for no control, yield control, stop control, or all-way stop control. FHWA proposes these changes to incorporate the results of a NCHRP Project 03–109, (http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/172596.aspx)	which	proposed	general considerations, alternatives to changing right-of-way control, and forms of unsignalized control from least restrictive  to  most  restrictive,  beginning  with  no control and concluding with all-way stop control.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>52. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, "Section 2B.06 General Considerations," incorporating some paragraphs from existing Section 2B.04 and proposed new general Support and Guidance paragraphs regarding signing for right-of- way at intersections.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes adding the Support regarding the types of right-of-way control that can exist at an unsignalized intersection based on the research results of NCHRP Project 03–109 (<a href="http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/172596.aspx">http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/172596.aspx</a>)</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes adding Item G, suggesting the presence of a grade crossing near an intersection as a factor to consider when selecting a form of traffic control. FHWA proposes this additional item to address the potential for resultant queues at an intersection that may extend toward a nearby grade crossing.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are all adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, the phrase "for all road users" is added to the end of P3 for clarification.   Further, in response to a comment, item B of the 2nd Guidance statement is revised to more correctly include all modes of conflicting traffic, including bicycles and pedestrians.</p>

	<p>58. FHWA proposes to add new section numbered and titled, “Section 2B.12 All-Way Stop Control,” consisting of one paragraph relocated from existing Section 2B.07 and proposed new Guidance and Standard paragraphs regarding warrants for all-way stop control. FHWA proposes this new section to clarify the application of all-way stop control and provide an introduction to the proposed new sections (Sections 2B.13 through 2B.17) related to all-way stop control warrants.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, an introductory Support statement is added to introduce the topic of all-way Stop control.  Further, in response to a comment, an Option paragraph is added to allow the use of engineering judgment in making a decision to use all-way Stop control on site roadways open to public travel, because of the low speeds and unique conditions associated with such roadways.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A commenter recommended comprehensive re-examination of warrant criteria for Sections 2B.12 thru 2B.17, as well as criteria for warranting crosswalks and traffic signals in Parts 3 and 4, to update them to more current research and make them more uniform and consistent in approach. Such re-examination will be considered for a future edition.</p>

FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2B.16 All-Way Stop Control Warrant D: 8-Hour Volume (Vehicle, Pedestrians, Bicycles),” consisting of one proposed new Option paragraph regarding the selection considerations for all-way stop control based on the criteria included in Table 2B–2.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The FHWA disagrees with a comment suggesting the average delay of 30 seconds per vehicle during the highest hour should remain in this warrant. The provisions are based on research and although the NCHRP study had a warrant that was for peak-hour delay, knowing the average delay per vehicle and not considering the total system delay provides little value because of the potential for a small number of vehicles. A metric of delay per vehicle is not an appropriate one for determining a warrant. Further, an engineering study has to be conducted as described in the Support for these sections where engineering judgment might determine that at a particular location delay is a critical factor.</p>

	<p>64. In Section 2B.18 (existing Section 2B.10) STOP Sign or YIELD Sign Placement, FHWA proposes to remove existing Standard P4 through P6 restricting the use of inventory stickers and other items on STOP and YIELD signs, because those restrictions apply to all signs, not just STOP and YIELD signs, and therefor and proposes to relocate this text to Chapter
2A.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Guidance limiting supplemental plaques used in conjunction with a STOP or YIELD sign to those specified in the MUTCD. FHWA proposes this change to ensure consistency in the use of supplemental plaques mounted beneath STOP and YIELD signs. FHWA also proposes to add an Option allowing the use of a TO TRAFFIC IN CIRCLE (R1–2bP) or TO ALL LANES (R1–2cP) plaque, mounted below the YIELD sign, for locations where drivers must yield to traffic in a multi-lane roundabout. FHWA proposes this option to address situations that occur when drivers at a multi-lane roundabout are not anticipating the vehicle in the inside lane to maneuver to exit the roundabout.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are all adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, the existing Guidance paragraph in this Section  about  signs  mounted  back-to-back  with Stop or Yield signs is deleted because it conflicts with Section 1D.06.  Based on comments received on those provisions in Section 1D.06, the Guidance paragraph is relocated to Section 2A.05, as that is the more applicable Section, and a Support statement is added in Section 2B.18 referencing Section 2A.05 for provisions that restrict the protrusion of signs mounted back-to-back.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Further, in the third paragraph within the second Guidance statement of this section, the phrase “and channelized right turns” is inserted after “except at roundabouts” for consistency and completeness.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>65. In section 2B.19 (existing Section 2B.11) Yield Here to Pedestrians Signs and Stop Here for Pedestrians Signs (R1–5 Series),” FHWA proposes to add a Support statement describing the intent of the R1–5 series signs, which is to mitigate scenarios associated with pedestrian and vehicle visibility.    FHWA also proposes to revise the first sentence of Standard P1 to address confusion on the existing limitation of the R1–5 series signs that are only appropriate for use on multi-lane approaches where there is a multiple threat scenario that can block other drivers’ and pedestrians’ views of one another.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Support and the changes in Standard P1 are adopted as proposed, except that, in response to comments, two additional signs in the R1-5 series (R1-5d and R1-5e) are added as a Standard for trail crossings. Several comments requesting deletion of "multi-lane” in P1 so as to enable use of R1-5 series signs at single-lane approaches are not adopted. Experimentation with using these signs on single-lane approaches has been insufficient.  More data from well-designed experiments is needed in order to consider this in the future.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change the last sentence of
Standard  P1  to  correct  an  oversight  in  the  2009
Edition, prohibiting, rather than allowing, the use of the STATE LAW legend to be displayed at the top of these signs because the sign applies to the specific location for yielding or stopping in advance of a specific crosswalk that is occupied, rather than to the general requirement to yield or stop at occupied crosswalks.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed. A comment recommending to remove the prohibition on using the STATE LAW legend with R1-5 series signs is not adopted.	The  R1-6  sign  with  the  STATE  LAW legend  reminds  drivers  of  the  law  that  applies regardless  of  whether  the  sign  is  in  place  at  a specific location, whereas the R1-5 sign is specific to a multi-lane location to mandate where to yield or stop  and  is  intended  to  mitigate  the  multi-threat scenario; therefore, it would not be appropriate to have the STATE LAW header.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to change the advance placement distance portion of Guidance P2 to a Standard, requiring that the R1–5 series signs be placed 20 to 50 feet in advance of the nearest crosswalk line to ensure that they adequately mitigate the multiple threat scenario on a multi-lane approach, which places pedestrians at risk when a second vehicle blocks other drivers’ view of pedestrians and the pedestrians’ view of the vehicles approaching in the adjacent lanes. FHWA proposes this change to ensure that the placement of the signs does not interfere with signs at the intersection and/or potentially cause misinterpretation as a Stop- controlled intersection either by approaching traffic or traffic on the cross street, as FHWA has observed in practice.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change from Guidance to Standard is not adopted, based on comments citing the need to allow for increased flexibility based on site specific conditions, including sight distance, to further protect against the multiple threat scenario on multi- lane approaches.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option for the R1–5a and R1–5c signs with the schoolchildren symbol in place of the pedestrian symbol, provided that the signs are only used in advance of a marked crosswalk that  crosses  an  uncontrolled  multi-lane  approach within school zones. FHWA proposes this change to reflect Official Interpretation 2(09)–40(I) (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/
2_09_40.htm), allowing the use of the schoolchildren symbol in the R1–5 series signs, similar to the R1– 6 series In-Street Pedestrian Crossing signs when used at an unsignalized school crossing.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Option for the R1–5a and R1–5c signs with the schoolchildren symbol is adopted as a Standard for consistency with Part 7.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>66. FHWA proposes to renumber and retitle existing Section 2B.12, “Section 2B.20 In-Street and Overhead Pedestrian and Trail Crossing Signs (R1–6 and R1–9 Series)” to reflect the additional proposed Trail Crossing sign.  FHWA also proposes to revise existing Standard P3 through P5 to include the proposed new Trail Crossing sign. FHWA proposes to clarify in Standard P3 that no more than one in-street sign shall be placed in the roadway, on a lane line for a one-way roadway application, or on a median island. FHWA proposes this change to minimize sign proliferation in the roadway and to prevent potential distraction due to an overuse of signs at a single location. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement, in response to an apparent misinterpretation of the existing provisions as evidenced by a number of technical inquiries and observations of noncompliant field deployments.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The clarifications as proposed are not adopted.  New clarification is added to the Standard in Paragraph 04 for the allowable placement of these signs, including when it is determined that more than one sign or additional placement on the edge line might be beneficial.   Further, a new Support paragraph is added in the final rule referencing new provisions in Section 3I.02 that clarify the flexibilities available for the   use   of   channelizing   devices   at   mid-block pedestrian  crossings  in  conjunction  with  In-Street Pedestrian  Crossing  (R1‑6  Series)  Signs.     This Support will provide agencies further information on existing treatments that can provide additional emphasis for the pedestrian crossing and provide a channelizing and potentially calming effect on vehicle traffic.
</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change existing Option P7 to a Standard and add a new Standard to require that if used, the In- Street or Overhead Pedestrian or Trail Crossing sign shall be used as a supplement to a Pedestrian Crossing (W11–2) or Trail Crossing (W11–15) warning sign with a diagonal downward- pointing arrow (W16–7P) plaque at the crosswalk location. FHWA proposes this change to ensure that if an in-street or overhead sign is used, that the appropriate non-vehicular warning sign is in place to ensure uniformity in application at crosswalks. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which does not change the existing underlying requirement, in response to an apparent misinterpretation of the existing provisions as evidenced by a number of technical inquiries and observations of noncompliant field deployments.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add an Option allowing In-Street Pedestrian or Trail Crossing signs to be mounted back-to-back in the median or on the centerline of an undivided roadway. FHWA proposes this option to minimize the number of in-street obstructions at the crossing.  FHWA also proposes to clarify in Standard P8 that the In-Street Pedestrian or Trail Crossing sign and the Overhead Pedestrian Crossing or Trail sign shall not be used at crosswalks on approaches controlled by a traffic control signal, pedestrian hybrid beacon, or an emergency vehicle hybrid beacon. FHWA proposes this clarification to eliminate conflict between the sign that says STOP or YIELD and a green signal indication on a traffic control signal or hybrid beacon.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to add an Option statement permitting the use of the In- Street Pedestrian and Overhead Pedestrian and Trail Crossing sign at intersections or midblock pedestrian crossings with flashing beacons, because flashing beacons do not display a green indication, and therefore the use of this sign would not conflict with the signal indication.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Option is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to reword existing Option P15 to clarify that both the in-street and overhead mountings of signs may be used together at the same crosswalk.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>67. In Section 2B.21 (existing 2B.13) Speed Limit Sign (R2–1), FHWA proposes to reorganize and revise material  based  on  the  NTSB’s  recommendation (https://www.ntsb.gov/safety/safety-studies/ Documents/SS1701.pdf) to review how speed limits are determined. FHWA proposes to move and revise Guidance P10, 12, and 13 and Option P16 to earlier in the section to clarify the factors that should be considered when establishing or reevaluating speed limits within speed zones.  FHWA proposes changes to  reinforce  the  stated  understanding  that  other factors, in addition to the 85th-percentile speed, have a role in setting speed limits. FHWA retains reference to 85th-percentile speed as a factor that should be considered,	particularly	for	freeways	and expressways, as well as for rural highways, except those  in  urbanized  locations  within  rural  regions. FHWA also retains reference to the setting of speed zones in broad terms, thereby allowing agencies to establish   detailed   criteria   based   upon   national guidance  or  based  upon  research,  outside  the MUTCD. FHWA also proposes to add Support to this section directing users to FHWA's Engineering Speed Limits  web  page,  which  provides  information  on where to find additional resources on the methods and practices for setting Speed Limits for specific segments  of  roads  as  well  as  tools  to  assist practitioners, such as USLIMITS2.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this section, except as noted below.</p>

	<p>In addition to providing comment on this proposed change,  FHWA  also  requests  comment  on  the following additional recommendations of the NTSB report: (1) Removal of the 85th-percentile speed as a consideration in setting speed limits regardless of the type of roadway (this recommendation was based in part on the assumption that that the 85thpercentile speed can increase over time as a result of the posted speed limit); and (2) the requirement to use an expert system  to  validate  a  speed  limit  that  has  been determined through engineering study. Commenters are also requested to address likely outcomes if one or more of the other recommendations in the report, such as increased automated enforcement, were not implemented in conjunction with the speed-setting recommendations outlined in the report.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp"></p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change the second sentence of P4 from Standard to Guidance to recommend, rather than require, that additional Speed Limit signs be installed beyond major intersections and at other locations where it is necessary to remind road users of the applicable speed limit. FHWA proposes this change because engineering judgment is involved to determine what constitutes a major intersection.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed but relocated within the section.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to modify existing paragraph 9 to reference the Reduced Variable Speed Zone (W3–
5b) and Truck Speed Zone (W3–5c) signs in conjunction with their addition to Chapter 2C.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These  changes  are  adopted  as  proposed  but relocated within the section.</p>

	<p>As part of this change, FHWA also proposes to add an Option for the use of an END VARIABLE SPEED LIMIT (R2–13) sign at the downstream end of a variable speed zone to provide notice to road users of the termination of the zone.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes, in conjunction with the above, a Standard statement requiring an END TRUCK SPEED LIMIT (R2–14) sign be installed at the downstream end of the zone. This Standard is necessary to ensure that road users receive notice of the termination of a truck speed zone where trucks are allowed to resume the general regulatory speed limit.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to revise existing P18 to replace the term “changeable message sign” with
“variable speed limit sign” to reflect the sign type more accurately.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement requiring the variable speed limit sign legend "SPEED LIMIT" to be a black legend on a white retroreflective background, consistent with the standard legend and background on a Speed Limit sign. FHWA also proposes in this Standard statement to require the variable speed limit legend on a variable speed limit sign to be indicated by white LEDs on an opaque black background. FHWA proposes to add this Standard to clarify the text, as indicated in Official Ruling No. 2(09)–3(I).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to delete existing Option P19 and Guidance P20 and add a Support statement referencing Section 2C.14 for provisions for the use of a Vehicle Speed Feedback sign, to group that information in Chapter 2C Warning signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed but referencing Section 2C.13 instead.

	<p>Speed control and management are important elements in reducing fatalities and serious injuries, particularly on roadways where vehicles and vulnerable road users mix. States and local jurisdictions should set appropriate speed limits to reduce the significant risks drivers impose on others, vulnerable road users, and on themselves. In the NPA, FHWA proposed to reorganize and revise material in Section 2B.21 (formerly 2B.13 of the 2009 MUTCD) Speed Limit Sign (R2–1) based on the recommendation of the NTSB to review how speed limits are determined. The NPA proposed to clarify the factors that should be considered when establishing or reevaluating non-statutory speed limits within speed zones, and to reinforce that other factors, in addition to the 85th-percentile speed, have a role in setting speed limits.</p>

	<p>Speeding is one of the largest and most persistent contributing factors in fatal traffic crashes, resulting in nearly 100,000 fatalities over the past decade. The DOT's NRSS adopts a Safe System Approach which includes a focus on Safer Speeds as a core tenet and recognizes that achieving safe speeds requires a multi-faceted approach that leverages road design and other infrastructure interventions, speed limit setting, education, and enforcement.</p>

	<p>Over the past several editions, FHWA has sought opportunities to reduce the amount of superfluous or duplicative content for purposes of streamlining the MUTCD and improving its usability, especially when that content is outside the scope of the MUTCD, which is the appearance, operation, and other aspects of traffic control devices—signs, signals, and markings. A number of commenters suggested that the MUTCD should not contain procedures on how to set speed limits, and that it is beyond its scope. The FHWA will assess the viability of removing the speed limit setting provisions from the MUTCD in a future rulemaking. This topic is discussed in more detail later in this section.</p>

	<p>A large number of comments on the setting of speed limits were received from organizations, public jurisdictions, and individuals. Many comments were based on a presumption that speed limits are required to be set at the 85th-percentile speed. However, this presumption is inaccurate. There is no existing or new requirement that a speed limit must be set at the 85th-percentile speed. The MUTCD allows for roadway owners and engineers to consider a wide variety of other factors in the engineering study including road characteristics, roadside development and environment, pedestrian activity, parking, and crash experience. All these factors (including speed distribution) are analyzed as part of the required engineering study and it is through that comprehensive analysis that the appropriate speed limit is determined. Further, the MUTCD addresses only non-statutory speed limits. The MUTCD does not preclude States or localities from passing laws to set statutory speed limits. Comments varied broadly in scope and with recommendations that were sometimes conflicting in nature. For example, some commenters recommended completely removing the 85th-percentile speed as a factor to consider in an engineering study and instead requiring the Safe System approach. Others recommended retaining the 85th-percentile speed as a factor because it is a relevant data point that can be important as an indicator that other modifications or speed management strategies might be needed to achieve compliance or some level of a self-enforcing road or street design. Still other commenters suggested removing all material relating to speed limit setting from the MUTCD.</p>

	<p>The FHWA is in general agreement with removing provisions from the MUTCD that fall outside its scope, particularly when that information can be found in another source. As mentioned earlier, FHWA has sought opportunities to reduce certain content for purposes of streamlining the MUTCD and improving its usability. The NPA did not propose complete removal of all speed limit setting material as, at this time, there is not an authoritative alternative document on this topic to which practitioners could be directed. Removal of this information under the current rulemaking would leave practitioners without a comprehensive, updated, data-driven reference from an authoritative source outside the MUTCD, as well as potential gaps in available information. (Development of such a comprehensive guide for speed limit setting is in progress and is discussed later in this section.) Therefore, in this final rule FHWA retains provisions on setting non-statutory speed limits in Section 2B.21 but with updates and revisions to state the entire range of factors, recommended for consideration in the engineering study to set a speed limit. In addition, the revised provisions clarify the role of speed distribution in the engineering study in differing roadway contexts and environments.</p>

	<p>The NPA solicited comments on two specific recommendations of the NTSB report: (1) the removal of the 85th-percentile speed as a consideration in setting non-statutory speed limits and (2) a requirement to use an expert system to validate a speed limit that has been determined through engineering study. Commenters were also requested to address likely outcomes if one or more of the other recommendations in the report, such as increased automated enforcement, were not implemented in conjunction with the speed-setting recommendations outlined in the report. Very few commenters addressed these questions directly, but many commenters incorporated their views on the first question especially into their overall comments on the NPA language in Section 2B.21, as described earlier. The FHWA reviewed and considered all comments on Section 2B.21 in making the determinations for this final rule that are described herein.</p>

	<p>Safety is the DOT's priority. In furtherance of improving safety, in consideration of the comments received, and to further FHWA's statutory obligation under Section 11135 of BIL to provide for the protection of vulnerable road users, FHWA adopts the proposed NPA change to remove speed distribution from the existing Standard and instead include it in the Guidance provision among the recommended factors for the engineering study. The FHWA also adopts in this Standard a requirement that roadway context be considered in setting speed limits. The updated Guidance provision provides details on six factors to consider in engineering studies on setting speed limits, including roadway environment, roadway characteristics, geographic context, crash experience, speed distribution, and analysis of speed trends. This change clarifies that the engineering study is not just limited to the speed distribution and that the context of the roadway is part of the study. The Guidance also clarifies that on urban and suburban arterials and rural main streets, the 85th-percentile speed should not be used as the sole consideration in setting speed limits.</p>

	<p>The FHWA emphasizes that there is no existing or new requirement that a speed limit must be set at the 85th-percentile speed. Rather, the 85th-percentile speed is included as one of the factors, as referenced in the preceding paragraph, recommended for consideration as a meaningful data point within the engineering study and is a potential indicator that other modifications or speed management strategies might be needed to achieve compliance or some level of a self-enforcing design. This aspect of the engineering study is critical because, just as speed limits need to reflect the road design, the road design similarly needs to reflect the desired operating speed. The FHWA also emphasizes that the relative weight given to each of the recommended factors in the engineering study will depend on the context of the location under study and that the MUTCD does not prioritize any one factor over another.</p>

	<p>The FHWA revises the Guidance provision to provide additional flexibility in applying the factors that should be considered in the required engineering study. Also, FHWA adds the 50th-percentile (median) speed as recommended for consideration along with the 85th-percentile speed, because speed limits set below the 50th-percentile speed tend to encourage excessive violations and an analysis of both data points is appropriate as part of an engineering study. The FHWA adds Guidance for agencies to consider measures other than traffic control devices to help achieve desired vehicle operating speeds, when the 85th-percentile speed is appreciably greater than the posted speed limit or where past speed studies have indicated consistent increases in operating speeds. These measures include changes to geometric features and other speed-reduction countermeasures.</p>

	<p>The FHWA retains the proposed Guidance provision recommending, but not requiring, that the speed limit be set within 5 mph of the 85th-percentile speed only on freeways and expressways, and on rural highways outside urban areas or urbanized conditions, as these are the types of facilities where the other factors (such as vulnerable road users) generally do not exist such that this Guidance is appropriate. As Guidance, this provision provides sufficient flexibility to apply unique engineering considerations that might exist; however, FHWA provides additional context by describing this applicability when all factors described in Paragraph 7 have been considered and determined to be non-mitigating or are not present and the factors described in the new Guidance Paragraph 8 have been considered. In addition, FHWA clarifies that factors other than speed distribution should be considered during an engineering study when setting a non-statutory or posted speed limit, depending on the site conditions of the specific location.</p>

	<p>The FHWA introduces new Support information at the beginning of the section that discusses applying the provisions to set appropriate speed limits on non-limited access facilities where vehicle operators are more likely to encounter other road users, such as pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as clarify the application of expert systems and the Safe System approach. The new Support provision clarifies that a range of factors can influence the speed limit determined in the engineering study. These factors include land-use context, pedestrian and bicyclist activity, crash history, intersection spacing, driveway density, roadway geometry, roadside conditions, roadway functional classification, traffic volume, and observed speeds. The engineering study will determine which of the recommended factors will prevail in setting the appropriate speed limit and the new provisions are intended to ensure that practitioners consider all road users when setting a speed limit. The FHWA believes that the changes adopted as described herein will result in improved safety through the setting of speed limits that more appropriately reflect their environment and the mix of road users.</p>

	<p>To support and better emphasize the importance of roadway context in speed limit setting, FHWA is coordinating as a separate effort the development of a new, comprehensive Speed Limit Setting document to assist practitioners with information on the available tools and how factors for consideration can be used as part of the engineering study in setting a non-statutory speed limit. In conjunction with this effort, FHWA will assess the viability of removing the speed limit setting provisions from the MUTCD and will consider such a revision for a future rulemaking.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>71. In Section 2B.26 (existing Section 2B.18) Movement Prohibition Signs (R3–1 through R3–4, R3–18, and R3–27), FHWA proposes to add a Guidance recommending the use of Movement Prohibition signs only to prohibit a turn or through movement from an entire approach and not to designate movements that are required or permitted from a specific lane or lanes on a multi-lane approach. FHWA proposes this additional language to prevent the use of multiple conflicting movement prohibition signs along an approach where lane use signs and pavement markings would be more appropriate.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise the first item under Option P12 to replace the term “changeable message sign” with less specific language describing the operation of the sign.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to add a Standard statement regarding the use of blank-out LED signs and the allowable LED colors, to reflect current practice.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Option statement to allow the use of permanently mounted signs incorporating a supplementary legend showing the vehicle class restriction where the movement restriction applies to certain vehicle classes. FHWA proposes to add this language to provide agencies with flexibility in signing movement prohibitions for various vehicle classes without having to mount a plaque.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement describing the design of the blank-out part-time electronic display for the Movement Prohibition sign. This Standard is necessary to ensure design consistency and uniformity in appearance with static signs used for the same purpose.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">All of the changes are adopted as proposed., except that in the final paragraph of the section, the reference to use of One-Direction Large Arrow signs in the central island of a roundabout is removed (See items 90 and 118).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, in response to comments, P8 is revised from an Option to a Guidance, in order to increase uniformity and reduce the number of signs at a given location. Further, in P15 the word “specific” is added to clarify that the legends of the plaques cited are examples and that a specific mode exemption legend can be used as appropriate, and the paragraph is relocated to earlier in the section for better information flow.</p>

	<p>73. In Section 2B.28 (existing Section 2B.20) Mandatory Movement Lane Control Signs (R3–5, R3–5a, R3–7, R3– 19 Series, and R3–20), FHWA proposes to change the second sentence of Standard P1 to Guidance to provide flexibility as to where to place certain Mandatory Movement Lane Control signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change of the second sentence of P1 from a Standard to Guidance is not adopted, because the predictable placement of R3-7 signs is critical for all users, including CAV machine vision, and the placement of such signs well in advance is confusing.  As a result, the existing Standard is retained and is further clarified regarding placement location.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA also proposes to revise existing Standard P3 to prohibit explicitly the R3–7 sign from being mounted at the far side of the intersection, incorporating the existing Standard P1 that requires these signs to be located in advance of the intersection. FHWA proposes this change to reinforce the existing requirement, which is intended to avoid confusion with the sign applying to a downstream intersection as has been demonstrated in practice. If a sign at the far side of the intersection is determined to be needed, then the proposed revision to Standard P1 would allow for other signs to be mounted overhead and aligned with each lane adjacent to the signals. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change to prohibit explicitly the R3–7 sign from being mounted at the far side of the intersection is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the first phrase of Standard P4, which specifies the use of the Mandatory Movement Lane Control symbol signs when the number of lanes available to through traffic is three or more.  FHWA proposes to remove this requirement to promote uniformity, since there is already an existing post-mounted version of the sign (R3–7). In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to delete existing Guidance P5 in this section.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending the use of the EXCEPT BUSES or EXCEPT BICYCLES plaque where the lane restriction does not apply to buses or bicycles.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete existing Option P9 regarding the back-to-back mounting of a Mandatory Movement Lane Control (R3–5) sign for a left-turn lane and Keep Right (R4–7) signs, because the Mandatory Movement Lane Control (R3–5) sign is for overhead mounting and therefore installing a Keep Right (R4–7) sign on the back is not appropriate.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add an Option allowing the use of proposed new post mounted LANE FOR LEFT TURN ONLY and LANE FOR U AND LEFT TURNS ONLY (R3–19 series) signs on the median at the start of the taper to be used in situations where a left-turn lane is added at a median location. FHWA proposes these new signs to standardize the message for which a number of States use a variation.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Option is adopted as proposed, with editorial adjustments.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to revise Option P11 to indicate that the BEGIN RIGHT TURN LANE (R3–20R) and the BEGIN LEFT TURN LANE (R3–20L) signs may be used in situations where the turn lane may not be apparent. FHWA proposes this revision to clarify when it is appropriate to use the sign because other standard signs exist to indicate a mandatory turn lane.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Option paragraph about signs for a shoulder that is open to part-time travel is not adopted in Section 2B.28, but is instead relocated to Section 2G.21, where it is more appropriately located, and adopted there as Guidance.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance statement describing the recommended use of the DO NOT DRIVE ON SHOULDER (R4–17) sign at locations where the transition from a paved shoulder to a mandatory turn lane might not be apparent and traffic regularly enters the shoulder to access the turn lane. FHWA proposes this language to clarify the method to address this condition. Use of the BEGIN RIGHT TURN LANE sign is not intended for these situations.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Guidance about the use of the DO NOT DRIVE ON SHOULDER sign is revised to an Option, to better reflect the intended optional, rather than recommended, use of the sign.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting that the Standard requiring the R3-5 and R3-5a sign to be mounted overhead be changed to Guidance is not adopted. These signs most clearly show what movements are required from each lane when mounted overhead, and if overhead mounting is not feasible at a specific location, post-mounted R3-8 series signs can be used instead.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment that use of R3-7 signs be limited to "dropped" lanes only is not adopted, because there are many right (or left)-turn-only lanes that are non- dropped lanes but that can need regulatory signing. The R3-7 fulfills that need.  If the R3-7 could not be used for a non-dropped lane, there is no other lane- use control regulatory sign that could take its place. Overhead R3-5 signs would generally not be reasonably practical for most "typical" added turn lanes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, a comment requesting addition of an Option paragraph to clarify that signal poles, arms, and span wires are adequate placement, and that post- mounted Advance Intersection Lane Control (R3-8) signs are an acceptable alternative to overhead- mounted R3-5 signs is not adopted because this clarification is not needed and could also possibly cause confusion.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>74. In Section 2B.29 (existing Section 2B.21) Optional Movement Lane Control Sign (R3–6 Series), FHWA proposes to change the 2nd sentence of Standard P1 to Guidance to provide flexibility as to where to place the Optional Movement Lane Control signs. FHWA proposes to add a standard U- and Left-Turn symbol Optional Movement Lane Control sign R3–6a and a standard oblique multiple left symbol Optional Movement Lane Control sign R3–6b with specific reference in the Standard P1. FHWA proposes this change to provide for left-turn lanes from which a U- turn is allowed, such as at median left-turn lanes as well as where there are multiple left turn angled movements that can be made from the lane.</p>

	<p>FHWA  proposes  to  relocate  and  revise  existing Standard P5 to incorporate the requirement that the Optional Movement Lane Control sign be mounted overhead in Standard P1.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to delete existing Guidance P6, because Optional Movement Lane Control signs are mounted overhead, not post- mounted. The R3–8 Advance Intersection Lane Controls signs are post-mounted.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete existing Option P7 because the arrows on the sign indicate permitted movements and the text “OK” is repetitive and not needed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are all adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment that the 2nd sentence of P2 be restored to 2009 language only requiring overhead mounting of R3-6 signs if there are 3 or more approach lanes is not adopted.  The R3-6 signs are in the same category as R3-5 signs, which are required to be overhead regardless of number of lanes, so the requirement needs to be consistent.</p>

	<p></p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Also, a comment asking that P5 be changed from Standard to Guidance so that an R3-6 sign could be used alone to effect a turn prohibition is not adopted, because R3-1 through R3-4 signs are used to effect a turn prohibition and R3-6 is an inappropriate use.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>75. In Section 2B.30 (existing Section 2B.22) Advance Intersection  Lane  Control  Signs  (R3–8  Series), FHWA proposes to add TAXI, BUS, BIKE or bicycle symbol to the allowable word messages that may be used within the border in combination with arrow symbols on Advance Intersection Lane Control signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to remove OK and ALL from the optional word messages as the lane control arrows are indicating this movement as allowable.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add an Option statement allowing the R3–8 sign to be modified to show the bicycle lane with a white legend on a black background where bicycle lane is between two general purpose lanes. FHWA proposes these changes to provide additional options for alerting motor vehicles and bicyclists of appropriate lane usage in advance of an intersection.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change existing Guidance P3 to clarify that the Advance Intersection Lane Control sign should be placed either along the lane tapers or at the beginning of the turn lane. FHWA proposes this change because, if used in advance of the lane tapers, the sign and the available lanes would not match; therefore, the sign would not help a driver discern which lanes are added and could result in uncertainty due to its ambiguous message.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Standard statement to prohibit mounting an Advance Intersection Lane Control sign at the far side of an intersection to which it applies. FHWA proposes this statement to reinforce placement in advance of the intersection either along the lane tapers or at the beginning of the turn lane. This Standard is necessary in order to avoid potential confusion with the sign applying to a downstream intersection.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Standard statement requiring the R3–5bP and R3– 5fP to be mounted above the R3–8 sign, when the R3–8 sign only shows the two outermost lanes of the roadway. FHWA adds this sign to display a complete message to the road user to comprehend the application when not all of the lanes are being shown on the R3–8 series sign.</p>

	<p>79. In section 2B.38 KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS Sign (R4–16) and SLOWER TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT Sign (R4–3), FHWA proposes to make revisions to Option P1 and Guidance P2 to clarify that the KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS sign is to be used where there are two lanes in one direction of travel. As currently written, “multi-lane” implies that no matter how many lanes are present, all traffic should be in the right lane. The meaning of this sign is to indicate that the left lane is for passing only; therefore, the message on the sign is only appropriate for roadways with two-lanes in the same direction of travel.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that Section 2B.38 and 2B.39 are combined into a single section titled Section 2B.38 KEEP RIGHT EXCEPT TO PASS Sign (R4-16), SLOWER TRAFFIC KEEP RIGHT Sign (R4-3), and TRUCKS USE RIGHT LANE Sign (R4-5), incorporating appropriate text from the deleted Section 2B.39.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>In Section 2B.40 (existing Section 2B.32), retitled,
“Keep Right and Keep Left Signs (R4–7 Series, R4–
8 Series),” FHWA proposes to add a new Guidance statement recommending the word legend (R4–7a, R4–7b,  R4–8a,  or  R4–8b)  signs  should  be  used
instead  of  the  symbol  (R4–7  or  R4–8)  signs  to
emphasize the degree of curvature away from the approach direction where the approach end of the island channelizes traffic away from the approach direction, such as on a loop ramp, to define the intended uses of signs that have similar legends better.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.39.  The new Guidance is adopted as proposed, except that the proposed phrase "such as on a loop ramp" is not adopted because the text is clear without it and a figure illustrates the condition.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes additional Option, Support, and Standard statements regarding the use of the Keep Right sign on medians on divided highways, as the result of recent research (http://www.trb.org/Main/ Blurbs/178000.aspx),	to	provide	more	clarity regarding the proper use and placement of these signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting that the new Standard about placement of Keep Right signs at median noses be changed to Guidance to provide flexibility is not adopted.  This new Standard is necessary, based on NCHRP research that found these aspects of sign location, visibility, and angling provide important safety benefits in reducing wrong-way crashes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, a new Guidance provision is added that if a regulatory sign is used within the central island of a neighborhood traffic circle, the Keep Right with diagonal arrow (R4-7b) sign should be used.  This change is for consistency with similar provisions adopted for circular intersections in Chapter 2B.</p>

In Section 2B.46 (existing Section 2B.39) Selective Exclusion Signs, FHWA proposes to add provisions for a new No Snowmobiles Symbol sign (R9–15) that may be used where snowmobiles are prohibited on roadways or shared-use paths. FHWA proposes this new symbol sign based on research indicating that this symbol has high recognition value (https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/view/dot/34772/dot_34772_ DS1.pdf). FHWA also proposes to include provisions for the NO THRU TRAFFIC, NO THRU TRUCKS, AND EXCEPT LOCAL DELIVERIES plaque as typical exclusion messages to reflect common practice. FHWA also proposes to add a reference to R5–10, which would replace the current R5–10a sign. FHWA proposes to revise the R5–10a to include the legend
“ON FREEWAY” below the primary legend.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.45.   The changes are adopted as proposed, except that the proposed Option regarding the use of the No Snowmobiles (R9-15) sign is deleted and replaced with a new Option regarding the allowed use of a new R9-19P EXCEPT ON SHOULDER plaque with several different selective exclusion signs when the sign is not applicable to the shoulder.  Also, based on a comment, a new No ATVs symbolic sign is added.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to eliminate the word legend version of the NO TRUCKS (R5–2a) as an alternate to the No Trucks (R5–2) symbol sign. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with word message signs where a symbol sign exists.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed. A request that the word message sign NO TRUCKS be retained rather than deleted is not adopted. The commenter justified the request based on the retention of the R2-5b NO THRU TRUCKS word message sign. No comprehendible symbol for a “thru truck” has been developed, so retaining the word message is essential,  whereas  the  symbolic  No  Trucks  sign (R5-2) has been a standard sign for many years, so the word message variant is unnecessary and was removed.</p>

	<p>83. In  the  proposed  Sub-Chapter  DO  NOT  ENTER, WRONG WAY, AND ONE-WAY Signs and Related Signs and Plaques, FHWA proposes to reorganize the sections so that signs associated with wrong-way movements are consecutive sections rather intermixed with Selective Exclusion signs.  In concert with these changes, FHWA proposes to provide clarifications and correct inconsistencies between the text and figures related to wrong-way movement signing, as the result of recent research (http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/178000.aspx).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed reorganization and clarifications are adopted as proposed.   Based on a comment, potential consolidation of all provisions for “Wrong- Way Traffic Control at Divided Highway Crossings” into a single Section will be investigated and considered in the future.</p>

    <h3 id="section2B46">Section <span class="text_deleted">2B.37</span><span class="text_added">2B.46</span> DO NOT ENTER Sign (R5-1)</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>84. In Section 2B.47 (existing 2B.37), “DO NOT ENTER Sign (R5–1),” FHWA proposes, as the result of recent research (http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/178000. aspx), to clarify Standard P2 to require DO NOT ENTER signing where a two-way roadway becomes a one-way roadway and near the downstream end of an interchange exit ramp.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Standard paragraph requiring a DO NOT ENTER (R5–1) sign be installed at an intersection with a divided highway where the crossing functions as two separate intersections, except on low-speed urban streets.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to add Option statements allowing the use of DO NOT ENTER signs at an intersection with a divided highway where crossing functions as a single intersection, as well as allowing the omission of DO NOT ENTER signs at an intersection with a low- speed urban street that is a divided highway at a crossing that functions as two separate intersections.</p>

	<p>As part of these changes, FHWA proposes to recommend that if used at an intersection with a divided highway that functions as a single intersection, DO NOT ENTER signs should be placed on the outside edge of the roadway facing traffic that might enter the roadway in the wrong direction.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to delete existing Option P4, since it is incorporated in the proposed new language in this section. FHWA also to enhance the conspicuity of the sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.46. The changes are all adopted as proposed, except that the proposed added Option statement regarding the use of white or red LEDs within the border of the DO NOT ENTER sign is not adopted and instead a Support is added to refer to the information on this topic in Section 2A.12, which allows red or white LEDs for this use.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment suggesting adding an entirely new Section to consolidate all provisions for wrong-way traffic control is not adopted but will be considered in a future edition of the MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, in response to a comment, P1 from the 2009
MUTCD is deleted because the term “restricted” does not convey enough specificity for practitioners with respect to the proper application of DO NOT ENTER signs. As the NPA proposed new provisions to specify the use, which are further clarified as adopted, this Standard paragraph has been removed.
</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Additionally, in order to clarify use of R5-1 signs at directional diamond interchanges and other unconventional locations, a new Guidance is added for the placement of R5-1 signs at other locations for additional emphasis and at locations where geometric conditions might necessitate their use. Additional figures depicting such conditions will be considered in the future.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, an Option is added in response to comment asking to specifically allow an EXCEPT BICYCLES (R3-7bP) plaque to be used with a DO NOT ENTER SIGN when counter-flow bicycle traffic is allowed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A request for addition of an Option to allow the DO NOT ENTER sign to be omitted on low-speed site roadways open to public travel, such as in shopping center parking lots, if a Keep Right or ONE WAY sign is installed is not adopted. The KEEP RIGHT and ONE WAY signs are required for locations that act as a single intersection, which seems to be the example provided by the requester. Further, the Option in this Section provides for the exception to install a DO NOT ENTER on a low-speed urban street.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A request that an Option be added to modify P2, to allow DO NOT ENTER signs to be omitted where there is little chance of a driver being able to enter the ramp wrong way, is not adopted. Even at a cloverleaf, some drivers who are lost, disoriented, or distracted may attempt to turn into the off-ramp. Having DO NOT ENTER signs there can prevent serious or fatal wrong-way crashes on the freeway/expressway.</p>

    <h3 id="section2B48">Section <span class="text_deleted">2B.41</span><span class="text_added">2B.48</span> Wrong-Way Traffic Control at Interchange Ramps</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>86. Section 2B.49 (existing 2B.41) Wrong-Way Traffic Control at Interchange Ramps, FHWA proposes to add items F (Lane control or movement prohibition signs) and G (Keep Right signs) as traffic control devices that may be used to supplement the signs and pavement markings at interchange exit ramp terminals where the ramp intersects a crossroad in such a manner that wrong-way entry could inadvertently be made. FHWA proposes this new language, as the result of recent research, to provide additional tools for agencies to use to prevent vehicles from entering interchange exit ramps in the wrong direction.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Option statement for the use of a NO LEFT TURN (R3–2) sign on the left side of interchange entrance ramps where the ramp merges with the through roadway and the design of the interchange does not clearly make evident the direction of traffic. This text supports the sign shown in existing Figure 2B–19.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes that a supplemental R3-2 sign may be located on the right side of the entrance ramp at the gore if one is installed on the left to provide agencies with greater flexibilities in signing for wrong- way traffic control.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Option statement and accompanying figure for the use of a ONE-WAY sign and/or a NO TURNS (R3–3) sign on interchange entrance ramps where the ramp merges with the through roadway and the design clearly indicates the direction of flow, to provide agencies with greater flexibilities in signing for wrong-way traffic control.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.48. The changes are all adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete Option P5 referencing special needs or prohibitive information. FHWA proposes this change because the statement is nonspecific and Chapter 2A already contains language specifying that a decision to use a particular device at a particular location should be made on the basis of either an engineering study or the application of engineering judgment.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting to retain the removed Option P5 to allow “other standard warning or prohibitive methods and devices” as a deterrent to the wrong-way movement is not adopted. The removed Option is non-specific and is open to misinterpretation that can result in unproven devices being installed without successful experimentation or research.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA revises Option P6 to clarify that the low mounting height for an independent installation of a DO NOT ENTER or WRONG WAY sign is for locations along the exit ramp rather than at the intersection with the crossroad.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes an Option to allow the installation of a low-mounted WRONG WAY sign on the DO NOT ENTER assembly at the intersection with the crossroad, provided that the DO NOT ENTER sign is mounted at a height consistent with the requirements for signs in general. FHWA proposes this change to ensure that the basic signing is at the typical mounting height a road user would expect to see, while still allowing signs at a lower mounting height as a supplement that are intended for a potentially disoriented driver whose vision might be focused at a lower height.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting various changes to the Standard Statement and addition of new Guidance is not adopted because such changes would be outside the scope of this rulemaking.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Lastly, a comment requesting for two additional items to be added to the list in the first Option statement is not adopted because the suggested items do not fit well with the others and are not needed in this Section.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>87. In Section 2B.50 (existing Section 2B.40) ONE WAY Signs (R6–1, R6–2), FHWA proposes, as the result of recent research (http://www.trb.org/Main/Blurbs/
178000.aspx), to replace all language describing an intersection with a divided highway that has a median
width at the intersection itself of 30 feet with proposed
new language that describes the crossing of a roadway with a divided highway as an intersection operating as single or separate intersections. FHWA proposes these changes because it is important to base the application of ONE WAY signing on how the intersection functions, rather than the width of the median.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.49. The changes are adopted as proposed, except that all provisions in this section referring to use of One- Direction Large Arrow signs in the central island of a roundabout are removed, for consistency with other Sections.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Option P11 to indicate that a One-Direction Large Arrow sign may be used instead of or in addition to a ONE-WAY sign in the central island of a circular intersection. FHWA proposes this change to reflect the proposed removal of the Roundabout Directional Arrow from the MUTCD.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A significant number of commenters stated that the One-Direction Large Arrow sign is for horizontal alignment changes and is not appropriate at intersection approaches, including those entering a roundabout under Yield control. Based on the comments, the revision to the Option that allows the use of the One-Direction Large Arrow sign at a roundabout is not adopted. Instead, the use of the ONE-WAY sign for this condition as provided in the 2009 Manual is retained. These changes provide consistency with similar provisions adopted for regulatory signs at circular intersections elsewhere in Chapter 2B.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a Standard statement specifying that when a One-Direction Large Arrow sign is used without a ONE-WAY sign, the R6–
5P plaque shall be mounted below the Yield sign on the approach to a roundabout. FHWA proposes this to ensure that when only the One-Direction Large
Arrow is used that a regulatory message indicating
the direction of movements is provided.
</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete P10 and 13 because they are duplicative and contradictory, respectively, and therefore not necessary to include in the MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, an Option is added in response to comment allowing use of an EXCEPT BICYCLES plaque with ONE WAY signs to accommodate counter-flow bike lanes.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>90. FHWA proposes to delete existing Section 2B.43 Roundabout Directional Arrow Signs, because the design of the R6–4 series signs, for which there are 3 versions, confounds a warning sign with a regulation and, as a result, have become prone to misuse. To address the condition for which these signs were intended, this proposed change also includes associated changes to the use of ONE-WAY signs and the Large Arrow sign, as described above.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion of existing Section 2B.43 and the discontinuation of Roundabout Directional Signs discussed therein are adopted as proposed. FHWA received a significant number of comments regarding the current use of these signs and their understanding specific to regulatory movements at roundabouts. Most of the comments had common themes that included (1) the need for a regulatory sign on the central island to indicate the traffic flow in the circulatory roadway and prohibit wrong-way travel; (2) the use of a horizontal alignment sign for this purpose is inappropriate; and, to a lesser extent, (3) recommending deferral of any change pending investigation of international practice and/or that international practice is what dictates the R6-4 series sign. In response to these themes, FHWA’s position is that (1) the use of the One Way sign not only satisfies the need for a regulatory sign, but that the express purpose of the One Way sign is to regulate the mandatory direction of travel; (2) the concern about the use of a horizontal alignment sign in this application is valid and that premise would contraindicate not only the use of the One-Direction Large Arrow sign, but also the use of Chevrons and that a change to only one element of the sign (background color) does not substantively refute that premise; and (3) the proposed changes actually more closely align with international practices that generally include the use of the international equivalent of Chevrons in the identical form of those used on horizontal alignment changes, or the use of the international equivalents of either the One Way sign (for roundabouts) or the Keep Right sign (for smaller central islands similar to the neighborhood traffic circle).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Some commenters expressed concern about having to replace existing signs to comply with the new provisions. However, there is no compliance date associated with the discontinuation of these signs and, as a result, existing signs can remain as long as they are in serviceable condition. Agencies would have to comply for new installations or replacement of existing signs that are no longer serviceable.</p>

    <h3 id="section2B53">Section <span class="text_deleted">2B.47</span><span class="text_added">2B.53</span> Design of Parking, Standing, and Stopping Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>94. In Section 2B.54 (existing Section 2B.47) Design of Parking, Standing, and Stopping Signs, FHWA proposes to revise Standard paragraphs 2–4 to incorporate the proposed prohibitive and permissive parking sign classifications and provide additional information on the design of such signs in order to maintain consistency in general sign design, while also allowing flexibility for agencies to modify legends for specific regulations.</p>

	<p>To improve consistency in the information provided in parking signs, FHWA proposes to expand the list of parking information that should be displayed on signs existing in Guidance P5 to include qualifying or supplementary information, exemptions to the restriction of prohibition, and tow-away message or symbol.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Standard requiring the times and days for which parking regulations are in effect to be displayed on the signs if they are not in effect all times of day or all days of the week. FHWA proposes this to ensure consistent signing methods in order to improve clarity for drivers wanting to park.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to modify Option P18 regarding the use of word message plaques with the R8–3 series signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to remove the EXCEPT SUNDAYS AND HOLIDAYS (R8–3bP), LOADING ZONE (R8–
3gP), and X:XX A.M to X:XX P.M.(R8–3hP) plaques as these are generally in urban conditions and are
already covered by the R7 series parking signs.
</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to modify the ON PAVEMENT (R8–
3cP), ON BRIDGE (R8–3dP), ON TRACKS (R8–
3eP), and EXCEPT ON SHOULDERS (R8–3fP) by removing the plaque designations and combining the word legends with the standard NO PARKING symbol (R8–3) sign.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.53. The changes are all adopted as proposed, except that one new Option, regarding use of a double-headed arrow on a sign at an intermediate point in a zone, is adopted as Guidance.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting that the Tow-Away plaque be mounted at the top of an assembly rather than the bottom is not adopted, because the intent is for the plaque to supplement the parking restriction sign. The restriction is the most important message and should be on top, providing for consistency in all applications.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, a comment suggesting that Guidance P7 be changed to Option is not adopted, because no specific justification was provided for change in this existing 2009 text, and the arrows are especially important in urban areas.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting that THIS BLOCK be added in P9 is not adopted because that message can be confusing as to whether or not it applies to both sides of the street.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change the legend of the Emergency Snow Route (R7–203) sign to “Snow Emergency Route” to be consistent with the prevailing current practice and the fact that the restrictions apply during a declared snow emergency.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting that the R7-203 SNOW EMERGENCY ROUTE sign be reclassified as an Emergency Restriction sign, moved into the R8 series, and relocated to Section 2B.56 is not adopted. This temporary parking restriction is implemented due to weather conditions, while the R8 Emergency Restriction signs are regarding road users or their vehicles experiencing an emergency.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes several changes in this section to incorporate electronic payment, change the term “pay parking” to “metered parking” and other editorial changes to reflect current practice and commonly used nomenclature. This includes a proposed Option statement to accompany a proposed new Mobile Parking Payment plaque that may be installed below a Metered Parking sign.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option statement to allow the display of maximum time limits that vary by time of day or day of the week on the R7– 20 sign to be omitted and instead displayed on the multi-space parking meter so that they are visible to pedestrians as they make payments.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement immediately preceding existing Standard P8, to reiterate the existing requirement that the Accessible Parking (R7–8) sign display only the official International Symbol of Accessibility and not a modification thereof. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement in Chapter 2A.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Guidance statement to incorporate provisions for Electronic Vehicle parking. The proposed language is based on FHWA’s Memorandum on Regulatory Signs for Electric Vehicle Charging and Parking Facilities (https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/policy/rsevcpf memo/).</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete the second and third sentences of existing Option P14 regarding the color of the bus symbol and the use of transit logos on the R7–107 sign, or alternates, because the text is not necessary and the use of transit logos on a sign may not be practical.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA also proposes to delete the existing R7–7 sign, because the R7–107, as well as the R7–107a sign, are more distinguishable, and there is no need for an additional sign.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete P19 and 20 regarding color coding of parking time limits. FHWA proposes this change to streamline the design of parking signs and because the standard colors of the parking signs have specific meanings as prescribed by the manual. In addition, the time limits are adequately displayed by the numbers on the signs.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes new Guidance paragraphs at the end of the section regarding the use of legends other than those on standard parking signs and the letter height of the principal legend. FHWA proposes these new paragraphs to provide agencies flexibility in creating specific signs while maintaining uniformity in design provisions.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>95. In Section 2B.55 (existing Section 2B.48) Placement of Parking, Stopping, and Standing Signs, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending signs placed at the head of perpendicular parking stalls to be parallel to the roadway facing the parking stall. FHWA proposes this addition to promote uniformity and clarity in signing parking stalls.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change P4 from a Standard to a Guidance to recommend, rather than require mounting parking signs back-to-back at the transition point between two parking zones, to provide jurisdictions with flexibility when it might be impractical to mount signs back-to-back.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to relocate and revise the Option statement regarding the use of signs to display blanket regulations from existing Section 2B.47 to this section, because this section deals specifically with sign placement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.54. The changes are all adopted as proposed. A comment requesting deletion of the first sentence about jurisdiction-wide parking regulations is not adopted, because it is very common for towns and smaller cities to have parking regulations, such as “No Overnight Parking on any Street”, posted at the jurisdiction boundaries and this practice should be specifically allowed.</p>

	<p>98. In Section 2B.59 (existing Section 2B.52) Traffic Signal Pedestrian and Bicycle Actuation Signs (R10–1 through R10–4, and R10–24 through R10–26), FHWA proposes to revise Standard P1 to clarify that where manual actuation of a traffic signal is required for pedestrians or bicyclists to call a signal phase to cross a roadway, traffic signs related to pushbuttons at those traffic signals are required. FHWA proposes this change to reduce the burden of sign installation on agencies. In addition, FHWA proposes to add a new sign to the Option statement, allowing for the use of a PUSH BUTTON IS FOR AUDIBLE MESSAGE ONLY (R10–3j) sign to provide agencies with the option where a pedestrian pushbutton is only used to activate accessible pedestrian features.</p>

	<p>Similarly, FHWA proposes to add a new sign to the Option statement allowing for the use of a sign that indicates the pedestrian button can be activated by either pushing or waving.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to modify the legend of the R10–25 sign to “PUSH BUTTON FOR WARNING LIGHTS— WAIT FOR GAP IN TRAFFIC.” FHWA proposes this change because these signs are used only at uncontrolled crosswalk locations where pedestrian activated warning beacons only alert approaching traffic to the presence of a pedestrian, but do not assign right-of-way to conflicting traffic streams, such as with a traffic signal or hybrid- beacon. In such cases, pedestrians are required to wait for an acceptable gap in vehicular traffic and not enter the roadway in the path of a vehicle which is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>99. In Section 2B.60 (existing Section 2B.53) Traffic Signal Signs (R10–5 through R10–30), FHWA proposes to add Option and Guidance for the use of a text version of a LEFT TURN YIELD ON FLASHING YELLOW ARROW (R10–12a) sign with Flashing Yellow Arrow signals. FHWA proposes this change to promote uniformity in the use of signing for these signal applications.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.59. The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add new Standard, Support, Guidance, and Option statements regarding the use of a proposed new LEFT TURN YIELD TO Bicycles (R10–12b) sign to provide agencies with information regarding the use of this sign to notify turning motorists of the possibility for unexpected conflicting bicycle movement at certain locations.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed, with the exception that the second proposed Standard is not adopted, consistent with the provisions for the use of bicycle signal faces in the final rule in Chapter 4H. Additionally, the Support for the R10-12b is not adopted based on comments and because the Standard adequately conveys the use of the sign.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add provisions for a new WAIT ON STEADY RED—YIELD ON FLASHING RED AFTER STOP (R10–23a) sign as an alternative to the R10–23 sign at pedestrian hybrid beacons. The
2017 Traffic Control Devices Pooled Fund Study
(http://www.pooledfund.org/Document/Download/75
59) evaluated the comprehension and legibility of various alternatives for signing at midblock hybrid beacon pedestrian crossings. The results indicated that no significant differences were found between the alternatives; however, they did highlight the need for a sign, at least initially, while drivers are learning what actions to take based on the flashing beacon.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed, except that the legend of the R10-23a sign is revised to STOP ON RED - YIELD ON FLASHING RED AFTER STOP to better indicate what drivers are expected to do. A comment requesting that the R10-23a sign legend be changed to that described in an official interpretation is not adopted, because the sign in the interpretation did not address exactly what the driver is supposed to do in response to the flashing red.</p>

	<p>As a result, FHWA proposes to add a word message sign for jurisdictions that determine the operational need at pedestrian hybrid beacons. FHWA also proposes to add an Option for a STOP HERE ON FLASHING RED (R10–14b) sign to provide extra emphasis at an emergency-vehicle hybrid beacon.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Standard to accompany a proposed new optional Turning Vehicles Stop for Pedestrians (R10–15a) sign to remind drivers who are making turns to stop for pedestrians, which shall be used only in jurisdictions where laws, ordinances, or resolutions specifically require that a driver must stop for a pedestrian.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed but with the addition of new guidance for the placement of the R10-15 series signs to assist practitioners with properly locating the signs at signalized intersections. Many commenters suggested to revise this Section to allow the use of the modified R10-15 sign, which includes the pedestrian and bicycle symbols, adjacent to shared use paths and along roadways with separated bicycle lanes. Due to the complexity of interactions between motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians on separate crossing paths at intersections, and the potential for differences in yielding and stopping requirements in each case, an effective concise sign legend with demonstrated adequate comprehension and recognition is not available for this rulemaking. The evaluation of additional sign concepts in typical geometric conditions where the turning motorist can see far enough to give approaching cyclists stopping sight distance will be considered in the future.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add an Option statement allowing the use of a U TURN SIGNAL (R10–10a) sign adjacent to a signal face that exclusively controls a U turn movement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Also, several additional commonly used signs associated with signal control are added for optional use, and the use of the R10-16 sign is changed from Option to Guidance, for safety reasons. The assignment of right of way in this circumstance is not clear and it is an unexpected condition for which signing is recommended for safety. Additionally, a Guidance paragraph is added regarding signs used with right turn signals. Further, several paragraphs are relocated within the section to improve the flow of information</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting deletion of the R10-5 sign is not adopted, because some jurisdictions have not yet upgraded to use of the red arrow signal indication, so it is premature to delete this sign.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>100. In Section 2B.61 (existing Section 2B.54) No Turn on Red Signs (R10–11 Series, R10–17a, and R10–30), FHWA proposes to change the designations of the No Turn on Red signs such that the word only message signs are designated R10–11 and 10–11a and the NO TURN ON RED with the symbolic circular red sign is designated as R10–11b. FHWA proposes this change to designate consecutively the word only message sign designations.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.60. The changes are all adopted as proposed, except that the proposal to change the designation of the version of the No Turn on Red sign with the symbolic circular red to R10-11b is not adopted. However, editorial revisions in P1 requested by commenters to clarify the use of the different varieties of No Turn on Red signs are adopted. Additionally, item C of P3 is revised to also address an exclusive bicycle phase. Further, a Standard paragraph about locations of No Turn on Red signs depending on distance from the stop line is relocated here from Section 2B.02, as this is the more appropriate location for it.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to relocate existing Option P4 and revise Option P5 to indicate that a blank-out sign is the primary Option for displaying a parttime NO TURN ON RED restriction.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes an Option statement that allows the use of white LEDs in the border, and activated during periods of turn prohibition, to enhance sign conspicuity.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">A comment requesting removal of the Option paragraph allowing white LEDs in the sign border is not adopted, as no justification was provided by the commenter.</p>

	<p>102. In Section 2B.66 (existing Section 2B.59) Weight Limit Signs (R12–1 through R12–7), FHWA proposes to add Guidance statements regarding the use of weight limit signs to indicate a structure has a vehicle weight restriction.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The section is adopted as Section 2B.64.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending that the term used for units shown on weight limit signs be consistent within a State or region with respect to pounds or tons.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes that the vehicle weight restrictions be depicted based on gross vehicle weight, and that weight per axle or empty vehicle weight should only be used when required by local laws to depict weight restrictions in that manner.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Guidance is not adopted and instead two Option paragraphs are added to allow legends regarding axle weight limits.</p>

	<p>In conjunction with this change, FHWA proposes to delete existing Guidance P2 and P4 regarding axle weight limits. FHWA proposes this change, in concert with the new Option provisions related to Specialized Hauling Vehicles and the proposed R12–6 sign which allows for a more comprehensive posting gross weight based on axle configurations and vehicle types. The proposed sign allows for distinguishing a single-unit vehicle and a combination vehicle while restricting to other vehicle types or reducing the mobility of vehicles that should not be restricted.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">As noted above, two new Option paragraphs are added to allow legends regarding axle weight limits.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete existing Guidance P3 regarding restrictions on trucks in residential areas, because the sign is not conveying a weight restriction, but rather a selective prohibition of trucks in a neighborhood. A new NO THRU TRUCKS sign is being proposed in conjunction with this change in
2B.52 to convey more effectively the intent of the restriction.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Support and Option provisions related to Specialized Hauling Vehicles, which are single-unit trucks with closely spaced axles, for which weight limit signs displaying restrictions based on the number of axles may be used.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed, with editorial adjustments.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add several Standard statements regarding the symbols shown on the R12–5 and R12–
6 Weight Limit signs. The symbols used are required to apply to all trucks of the type shown (single-unit, single-trailer or multi-trailer) regardless of the shape
of the vehicle. Symbolic representations of other
vehicle shapes or modifications of standard symbols shall not be used in accordance with existing requirements in Chapter 2A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The new Standard statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending that Weight Limit signs show no more than 3 symbols in order to promote driver comprehension.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The added Guidance is not adopted, since sometimes more than three symbols are required by State laws.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to incorporate Guidance P7 into Standard P6 to require, rather than recommend that, if used, the Weight Limit sign, with an advisory distance ahead legend, shall be located in advance of the applicable section of highway or structure so that prohibited vehicles can detour or turn around prior to the limit zone. FHWA proposes this change to give vehicles affected by weight limit restrictions adequate information about the distance to the restricted area so that they can properly change their route and to minimize potential damage to highway infrastructure as a result of an overweight vehicle.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change to require the advance sign is adopted as proposed, except that a directional legend is added as an alternative to the advisory distance ahead legend. The requirement for advance signing is critical for prohibited vehicles to be able to detour or turn around prior to the restriction, thus minimizing potential damage to highway infrastructure as a result of an overweight vehicle. The single Standard paragraph proposed in the NPA is adopted as two separate paragraphs, with text added to the first paragraph to clarify that a Weight Limit sign shall be posted directly at the applicable section of highway or structure, while the second paragraph requires the advance posting of the sign with advisory distance or directional legend.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes provisions for the use of proposed new Emergency Vehicle Weight limit signs to address conditions where emergency vehicles can create higher load effects compared to legal loads. The R12–7 sign is for independent use and the R12–7aP plaque is for use only in a sign assembly below a primary regulatory Weight Limit sign.</p>
