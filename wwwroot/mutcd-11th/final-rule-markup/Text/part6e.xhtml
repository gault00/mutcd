To provide coordination of the control of the traffic, the flaggers should be able to communicate with each other orally, electronically, or with manual signals. These manual signals should not be mistaken for flagging signals.</span></p>

A variation of this method is to replace the use of a flag with an official pilot car that follows the last road user vehicle proceeding through the section.</span></p>

	<p>478. In Section 6E.04 (existing Section 6C.13) Pilot Car Method, FHWA proposes to revise the Standard statement to allow mounting of the sign on top of the pilot vehicle as well as on the rear, and to clarify that pilot car operations shall be coordinated with flagging or other control methods, as this is necessary for safety.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard to require a flagger to operate an Automated Flagger Assistance Device (AFAD) in pilot car operations based on Official Ruling No. 6(09)â€“15(I) (<a href="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/6_09_15.htm">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/6_09_15.htm</a>) to clarify that an AFAD is not a temporary traffic control signal and should not be operated in an automatic manner.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">These changes are adopted as proposed, except that based on comment, clarification is added that the flagger operating the AFAD cannot be in the pilot vehicle, and a recommendation is added that signing should be considered if temporary traffic control signals are used and wait times might be long.</p>
