	<p>360. In Section 3E.02 (existing Section 3D.02), retitled, “Longitudinal Markings,” FHWA proposes to revise P3 to reference Table 3E–1 (existing Table 3D–1), create a new Table 3E–2 Standard Edge and Center Line Markings for Counter-Flow Preferential Lanes, revise P9 and P10 to reference new Table 3E–2, and remove redundant text. FHWA proposes to make these changes to clarify the preferential lane marking requirements and improve readability.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Existing Table 3D-1 is revised to be Table 3E-1 and new Table 3E-2 is adopted as proposed with the title Standard Edge Line and Center Line Markings for Counter-Flow Preferential Lanes on Divided Highways.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance regarding chevron spacing is removed in response to comments received. Guidance on chevron spacing may be found in Section 3B.25.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Guidance paragraph recommending that buffer space for a conventional road should be designed so that it is not misinterpreted as a bicycle lane or other type of lane.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments and for consistency with the Standard in Section 3B.07, the Guidance regarding the use of dotted white line markings to separate tapered or parallel deceleration lane from the adjacent continuing preferential through lane is changed from a Guidance to a Standard.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add new Figure 3E–4 to illustrate an example of pavement markings used for counter-flow preferential lanes on divided highways.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Figure 3E-4 is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>361. In Section 3E.03 (existing Section 3D.01) Preferential Lane Word and Symbol Markings, FHWA proposes to change existing P3 regarding preferential lane longitudinal markings, word, and symbol markings at the downstream end of the lane from Standard to Guidance to provide agencies the flexibility to determine the ideal location based on site conditions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing Standard to Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Standard P6 and combine with P2 and remove Item C. Bicycle Lane since preferential lanes for bicycles are covered in Part 9 and no longer apply in this Chapter and Section.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standard P6 is combined with P2 as proposed, with item B separated into two items: item B. ETC Account-Only lane and item C. Price-managed lane. Although some comments requested bicycle lanes remain in this standard, other comments were received in support of the proposed change to move all bicycle lane information to Part 9, and the change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add BUS STOP and TAXI STAND as required word markings for their respective uses in preferential lanes based on common practices.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The provisions on BUS STOP and TAXI STAND word markings are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to change P7 regarding preferential lanes with two or more permitted uses in the same lane from Standard to Guidance to remove the requirement for providing both symbols or words and instead allow engineering judgment to prioritize and select either symbols or word markings, or both.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Changing Standard to Guidance is adopted as proposed, with edits for clarification consistent with the previous standard.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, an Option is added in the final rule to allow lane-use arrow markings to be placed on the curb lanes on approaches to intersection to signify non-preferential users can use the lane for turning movements. This is added since it may not be immediately clear to road users when the curb lane is converted from a general-purpose lane to a preferential lane.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes new Standard and Support paragraphs restricting the use of word or symbol markings denoting motorcycle and Inherently Low Emission Vehicles (ILEV). FHWA proposes this change because motorcycle and ILEV vehicle use is communicated using regulatory signing to complement high occupancy vehicle regulations and simplifies enforcement functions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standard and Support are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<h3 id="section3E03">Section 3E.04 Markings for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>362. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 3E.04 Markings for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder” to provide Standard, Guidance, Option, and Support paragraphs for situations where shoulders are designated for use during peak hour conditions to increase roadway capacity. FHWA proposes this change based on a Transit Cooperative Research Program Report (<a href="http://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/166878.aspx">http://www.trb.org/Publications/Blurbs/166878.aspx</a>) as well as to address increasing needs of agencies to add roadway capacity in constrained urban areas.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 3E.04 Markings for Part-Time Travel on a Shoulder is adopted with revisions. The proposed Option which would have allowed a yield line pavement marking to be installed on the shoulder unaccompanied by a Yield sign where transit vehicles on the shoulder yield to traffic entering from an on- ramp is not adopted. The orientation of the dotted edge or extension line is intended to indicate whether traffic utilizing a part-time shoulder is required to yield to ramp and/or turning general purpose traffic.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Figures 3E–5 and 3E–6 to illustrate examples of markings for part time travel on a shoulder.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Figures 3E-5 and 3E-6 are adopted with revisions. Additional displays are added to Figure 3E-5 in response to comment. Requested annotations on Figure 3E-5 of merge, diverge, and weave were not included, as general-purpose traffic and part-time travel on shoulder traffic will always weave, unless the part-time travel on shoulder traffic is required to merge back into the general purpose lanes prior to a ramp. Other revisions were completed for consistency with the provisions in Chapter 2G and Section 3E.04.</p>
