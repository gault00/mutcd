	<p>517. As part of the reorganization, FHWA proposes to consolidate Chapter 7A into two sections numbered and titled, “Section 7A.01 Introduction” and “Section 7A.02 School Route Plans and School Crossings.” The two sections consist of provisions from existing Section 7A.01 through Section 7A.04.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The consolidation of Chapter 7A into two sections is adopted as proposed.</p>

    <h1>Chapter 7A. General</h1>

	<h3 id="section7A01">Section <span class="text_deleted">7A.04</span><span class="text_added">7A.01</span> <span class="text_deleted">Scope</span><span class="text_added">Introduction</span></h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>518. In Section 7A.01 “Introduction,” FHWA proposes to change existing P1 in Section 7A.04 from a Standard to Support because the general information in this paragraph describing the scope of Part 7 is more appropriate as a Support statement.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete existing Support P2-4 and the first sentence of P5 that contain references to other sections, chapters, and parts in the Manual, because this text is unnecessary. The MUTCD users are accustomed to knowing that other areas of the Manual should be consulted when working in Part 7, because school areas include signs, pavement markings, and traffic signals. FHWA retains the reference to the School Crossing signal warrant, because it is specific to school areas.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except that P2 is deleted and instead the reference to the School Crossing signal warrant in Part 4 is relocated to Section 7A.02. A comment suggesting an additional reference, to Section 2B.17 for the all-way stop warrants, is not adopted because all-way stops are not specific to school areas, while the school crossing signal warrant is specific to school areas.</p>

	<h3>Section 7A.01 Need for Standards</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="support">Regardless of the school location, the best way to achieve effective traffic control is through the uniform application of realistic policies, practices, and standards developed through engineering judgment or studies.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support">Pedestrian safety depends upon public understanding of accepted methods for efficient traffic control. This principle is especially important in the control of pedestrians, bicycles, and other vehicles in the vicinity of schools. Neither pedestrians on their way to or from school nor other road users can be expected to move safely in school areas unless they understand both the need for traffic controls and how these controls function for their benefit.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support">Procedures and devices that are not uniform might cause confusion among pedestrians and other road users, prompt wrong decisions, and contribute to crashes. To achieve uniformity of traffic control in school areas, comparable traffic situations need to be treated in a consistent manner. Each traffic control device and control method described in <a href="part7_toc.html">Part 7</a> fulfills a specific function related to specific traffic conditions.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support">A uniform approach to school area traffic controls assures the use of similar controls for similar situations, which promotes appropriate and uniform behavior on the part of motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support">A school traffic control plan permits the orderly review of school area traffic control needs, and the coordination of school/pedestrian safety education and engineering measures. Engineering measures alone do not always result in the intended change in student and road user behavior.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="support">Reduced speed limit signs for school areas and crossings are included in this Manual solely for the purpose of standardizing signing for these zones and not as an endorsement of mandatory reduced speed zones.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support">“School” and “school zone” are defined in <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A13">Section 1A.13</a>.</span></p></span>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>Section 7A.02 School Route Plans and School Crossings (not discussed in the NPA Preamble)</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes in this section are adopted as proposed, except that Support P1 in existing Section 7A.03, which was proposed for deletion (see below), is instead retained, and placed into Section 7A.02, as suggested by comments, as it is relevant information for consideration during the planning of school walk routes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The reference to Section 4C.06 for the School Crossing signal warrant is relocated to this section from Section 7A.01 as noted previously.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In addition, in response to a commenter suggestion, a new Guidance paragraph is added stating “Bicycle use as a mode of transportation, as applicable, should also be considered if students biking to and from school are not allowed to use the sidewalks along the pedestrian route.” This guidance is added to address students bicycling to and from school.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A comment recommending deletion of "law enforcement” from the list in P1 of those who develop the school route plan is not adopted, as law enforcement would be aware of crashes that are occurring as well as operational issues or traffic violations in the area that are reoccurring, and thus should be involved.</p>
