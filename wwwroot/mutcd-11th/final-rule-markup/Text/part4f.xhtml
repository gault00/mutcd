	<p>383. FHWA proposes to allow the optional use of three- section signal faces using flashing yellow arrow (FYA) signal indications that use the middle section to show both the FYA and the steady yellow arrow in Section
4F.08 (existing Section 4D.02) retitled, “Signal Indications for Protected/Permissive Mode Right- Turn Movements in a Shared Signal Face” and Section 4F.15 (existing Section 4D.24) retitled,
“Signal Indications for Protected/Permissive Mode Right-Turn Movements in a Separate Signal Face.” This change would allow agencies to convert existing
three-section protected-only left- and right-turn signal
faces to three section FYA signal faces and provide more opportunities to implement variable mode left- and right-turn phasing.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are generally adopted as proposed but revised to encourage the use of the three-section bimodal signal indication with flashing yellow arrow and steady yellow arrow in the same section in the middle section instead of the having the flashing yellow arrow and green arrow in the same section. The three-section bimodal signal indication with flashing yellow arrow and steady yellow arrow in the same section showed better driver comprehension based on the supporting research.</p>

	<p>Similarly, FHWA also proposes to allow the option of displaying both the FYA and the steady yellow arrow in the same section for five-section shared left- turn/right-turn	signal	faces	operating	in protected/permissive mode in Section 4F.02 (existing Section 4D.17) Signal Indications for Left-Turn Movements—General, 4F.09 (existing Section 4E.21) Signal Indications for Right-Turn Movements— General, and Section 4F.16 (existing Section 4D.25) retitled, “Signal Indications for Approaches with Shared Left-Turn/Right-Turn Lanes and No Through Movement.” FHWA proposes these changes based on Interim Approval 17 (http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interim_approval/ia17/index.htm), FHWA’s Official Ruling No. 4(09)-15(I) (http://mutcd.fhwa. dot.gov/resources/interpretations/4_09_15.htm), and supporting research (http://www.trb.org/Main/ Blurbs/171653.aspx). FHWA also proposes revisions to various paragraphs and sections throughout the part to reflect these proposed changes.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are generally adopted as proposed. In Section 4F.02, the Option in P9 is modified from the NPA to include all situations with a combined left-and- through lane and not only when there is also an exclusive left-turn lane. This revision was based on comments that noted the benefit of using this variable mode left-turning phasing operation on approaches without an exclusive left-turn lane, especially in urban areas.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>405. In Section 4F.01 (existing Section 4D.05), retitled,
“Application of Steady and Flashing Signal Indications during Steady (Stop-and-Go) Operation,” FHWA proposes to add items E and G to Standard P3
to include provisions for flashing red arrow and
flashing yellow arrow signal indications for steady (stop-and-go) mode of operation. FHWA proposes this change to clarify the application of flashing signal indications in steady (stop-and-go) mode based on their addition to the 2009 MUTCD.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to clarify in Item H that except for under certain circumstances, a steady green arrow signal indication shall be displayed only to allow vehicular movements in the direction indicated, that are not in conflict with other vehicles moving on a green or yellow signal indication, even if the other vehicles are required to yield the right-of-way to the traffic moving on the GREEN ARROW signal indication. FHWA proposes this clarification to reflect Official Change Request 4(09)–75 (https://mutcd.fhwa. dot.gov/orsearch.asp).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.

</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to expand existing Option P5 to include conditions where a steady straight-through green arrow may be used to discourage wrong-way turns. FHWA proposes this clarification to reflect Official Change Request 4(09)–75 (C) (https://mutcd. fhwa.dot.gov/orsearch.asp).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is generally adopted as proposed. Anew Item D is added to allow a steady straight-through GREEN ARROW signal indication on an approach with pre-signals and adjacent lanes are controlled separately based on revisions in Sections 8D.11 and
8D.12.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Standard, prior to existing Standard P13, for signal displays on separate signal faces at pre-signals for left-turn and/or right- turn lanes that extend from the downstream signalized intersection back to and across a grade crossing. FHWA proposes this change to permit agencies to display straight-through green arrow with circular red or circular yellow on the same approach to the pre-signal to improve safety by discouraging road users from inadvertently turning onto railroad or light rail transit (LRT) tracks.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is generally adopted as proposed. Based on comments received, queue cutter signals are also included.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>406. In Section 4F.02 (existing Section 4D.17) Signal Indications for Left-Turn Movements—General, FHWA proposes to change P1 from Standard to Support because the paragraph provides information regarding the applicability of signal indications for U-turns to the left and is more appropriate as a Support statement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Standard P5 to prohibit explicitly the simultaneous display of a protected left-turn movement with opposing right-turn green arrow or yellow arrow signal indication unless there are separate departure lanes available and there are pavement markings or a channelizing island clearly indicating which departure lane to use. This prohibition has been implicit in the description of what constitutes conflicting movements elsewhere in Part
4, but FHWA proposes this change to be specific about conflicting movements between left-turns and opposing right-turns.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to modify Standard P6 to clarify which signal displays are prohibited when a combined left-turn/through lane exists on an approach.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes similar changes in Section 4F.09 (existing Section 4D.21) for right-turn movements.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In Section 4F.02 (existing Section 4D.17) Signal Indications for Left-Turn Movements—General, comments were received regarding P04 where the NPA proposed to add a requirement for the opposing approach right-turning traffic to display green or steady yellow signal indications during a permissive left-turn movement. The commenters were concerned that the proposed change will prohibit a right-turn flashing YELLOW or RED ARROW. Based on these comments, the proposed change is not adopted.</p>

FHWA proposes this change because if an exclusive lane does not exist, then a separate turn signal face should not be provided because both the turning and through vehicles share the same lane and a separate turn signal face can be confusing to road users in this situation.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>411. In new “Section 4F.15 Signal Indications for Protected/Permissive Mode Right-Turn Movements in a Separate Signal Face,” which is comprised of existing P2–P6 of existing Section 4D.24, FHWA proposes to allow the display of a steady right-turn red arrow signal indication immediately following the steady right-turn yellow arrow signal indication to provide a red clearance interval, enabling the opposing traffic to start up before releasing the permissive right-turn movement.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new requirement to display a steady right-turn yellow arrow and if needed, steady right-turn red arrow following the flashing right- turn yellow arrow for permissive right-turn movements changing to protected right-turn movements when there is an opposing permissive left-turn movement that is being terminated simultaneously. FHWA proposes this change because a yellow change interval and red clearance interval might be needed during a right-turn overlap to allow opposing permissive left-turn traffic to clear the intersection.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed with editorial revisions.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">in addition, P4 is revised to an Option consistent with changes noted in item 383.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>412. In Section 4F.16 (existing Section 4D.25), retitled,
“Signal Indications for Approaches with No Through Movement,” FHWA proposes to expand information regarding signal displays in situations where all traffic on an approach must turn onto the intersecting roadway. Existing Section 4D.25 does not address situations for approaches where there is no through movement and there is not a shared left-turn/right- turn lane or the lanes operate with variable lane-use regulations.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is generally adopted as proposed with revisions noted below.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add an Option to allow the continuous display of a steady circular red signal indication during time when the traffic control signal is being operated in steady (stop-and-go) mode.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is generally adopted as proposed but the Option is revised to clarify that the CIRCULAR RED signal indication can be displayed while steady or flashing YELLOW ARROW and steady GREEN ARROW signal indications are displayed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Standard prohibiting the display of circular green and circular yellow signal indications to an approach with no through movement and an approach speed 35 mph or greater, to an approach where the one-way roadway that opposes the approach is an exit ramp from a freeway or expressway, or to an approach where the one-way roadway that opposes the approach has a speed limit of 35 mph or greater.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes the new Option and Standards to improve safety by minimizing the potential for road users driving straight through in the wrong direction onto a one-way roadway or exit ramp.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, P2 is revised to exempt single-lane approaches from the requirement of a minimum of two primary signal faces for the turning movement that is considered to be the major movement from the approach. This exemption allows two signal faces on a single-lane approach instead of three signal faces that was proposed to be required based on the NPA. A similar revision is made to P1 in NPA Section 4D.04, renumbered Section 4D.05.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>413. In Section 4F.17 (existing Section 4D.26) Yellow Change and Red Clearance Intervals, FHWA proposes to change P2 from Standard to Support because the paragraph describes the function of a yellow change interval, rather than specific requirements.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Support P7 to reference “Guidelines for Determining Traffic Signal Change and Clearance Intervals: A Recommended Practice of the Institute of Transportation Engineers,” which contains the current practices for determining the duration of yellow change and red clearance intervals.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is not adopted based on the comments received. Significant research is underway to evaluate the state of the practice nationally and to recommend an updated methodology to determine change and clearance intervals. The Support paragraph is deleted. This issue will be revisited in a future edition based on the outcome of that research.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to revise Guidance P14 to recommend the maximum duration of yellow change interval for through movements should be 6 seconds and for turning movements should be 7 seconds. As part of this change, FHWA proposes to delete the second sentence of Guidance P14 and Guidance P15. FHWA proposes these changes to reflect new guidance in the new ITE publication.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">This change is not adopted based on the comments received. The 2009 MUTCD text is retained since the reference to “Guidelines for Determining Traffic Signal Change and Clearance Intervals: A Recommended Practice of the Institute of Transportation Engineers” is not adopted.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>414. In new “Section 4F.19 Preemption Control of Traffic Control Signals” consisting of paragraphs from existing Section 4D.27, FHWA proposes to revise the Standard regarding preemption control transitions to permit the shortening or omission of any pedestrian change interval only when the traffic control signal is being preempted because a boat is approaching a movable bridge or because rail traffic is approaching a grade crossing. FHWA proposes this change to improve pedestrian safety. The existing MUTCD allows the shortening or omission of the pedestrian change interval regardless of the reason.
Unlike boats and trains, emergency vehicles and buses generally have the ability to slow, stop, or alter their course if necessary to avoid a collision.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Option permitting the display of a distinctive indication to inform law enforcement personnel who are escorting traffic that the traffic control signal has changed because it has been preempted. FHWA proposes this change based on an NTSB recommendation from the results of their investigation into the causes of the fatal truck/train crash that occurred in Midland, Texas, when law enforcement officers were escorting a parade (https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReport s/Reports/HAR1302.pdf).</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to modify P11 to recommend that backup power supply for traffic control signals with railroad preemption or coordinated with flashing-light signal systems should provide a minimum operating period sufficient to allow the implementation of alternative traffic control during a power outage. FHWA proposes this change to provide agencies with more guidance on the duration for backup power supplies.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed but the second sentence regarding the minimum operating period was deleted to allow engineering judgment.</p>

	<div class="fr">
	<p>In new “Section 4F.19 Preemption Control of Traffic Control Signals” consisting of paragraphs from Section 4D.27 of the 2009 MUTCD, FHWA proposed to revise the Standard regarding preemption control transitions to remove the current provision that allows the pedestrian change interval to be truncated during emergency vehicle preemption. The current provision potentially exposes vulnerable road users to great risk if they are crossing the street and their pedestrian indication is terminated mid-crossing to permit the signal to change to green on that approach in preparation for an approaching emergency response vehicle. The FHWA proposed this change to enhance the protection of vulnerable road users during emergency preemption operations at traffic control signals. Truncating the pedestrian change interval would still be allowed only when the traffic control signal is being preempted because a boat is approaching a movable bridge or because rail traffic is approaching a grade crossing, as emergency vehicles and buses generally have the ability to slow, stop, or alter their course if necessary to avoid a collision, which is not the case of boats and rail traffic.</p>
	<p>The FHWA received many comments on different sides of the issue. Some commenters supported the change since the existing method could potentially compromise pedestrian safety if pedestrians had not cleared the crosswalk during the transition into preemption control. Other comments opposed the change saying the effectiveness of the emergency vehicle preemption will be greatly diminished or made completely ineffective due to increased delay, especially in congested conditions. Some comments suggested the requirement did not go far enough in that it continued to allow pedestrian change interval to be preempted for signals associated with boat and rail traffic. The FHWA believes there is insufficient data on the magnitude of these potential issues and therefore does not adopt the proposed Standard that would prohibit the truncation of the pedestrian change interval during the transition into preemption control. Also, FHWA revises the existing Standard and adds an Option to further clarify what is allowed and what is prohibited by the existing provisions.</p>
