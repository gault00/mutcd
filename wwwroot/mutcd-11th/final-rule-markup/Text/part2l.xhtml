    <h3 id="section2L01">Section 2L.01 Description of Changeable Message Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>295. In Section 2L.01 Description of Changeable Message Signs, FHWA proposes to add a paragraph to the Support statement to clarify that Changeable Message Signs (CMS) are traffic control devices, and therefore fundamental principles for the design and application apply, regardless of the type of message. The statement further explains that Chapter 2L is not a standalone chapter and criteria and use of engineering processes in other areas of the MUTCD also apply to CMS.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support statement is adopted as proposed with a minor revision to change the reference to “traffic control device” in the second sentence to “conventional sign”. In addition, the proposed Support statement in Section 2L.06 is moved to Section 2L.01.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to relocate and revise Standard P3 to Section 2L.02, because this language applies to the applications of CMS and not the description of them.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standard P3 is revised and relocated from Section
2L.01 to Section 2L.02 as proposed.
</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Standard prohibiting information other than inventory or maintenance- related information from being displayed on the front or back of a CMS or portable CMS. This prohibition also includes names or logos of the manufacturer either in the message display or on the exterior housing. FHWA proposes this change to ensure the traffic control messages displayed on these signs are not compromised by other miscellaneous or promotional information, consistent with the provisions for all traffic control devices.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

    <h3 id="section2L02">Section 2L.02 Applications of Changeable Message Signs</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>296. In Section 2L.02 Applications of Changeable Message Signs, FHWA proposes to relocate and revise Standard P3 from Section 2L.01 because this language applies to the applications of CMS and not the description of them.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Standard P3 is relocated from Section 2L.01 to
Section 2L.02 as proposed.
</p>

	<p>As part of the revisions, FHWA proposes to clarify that CMS are to display only information as provided for in this chapter and other types of messages not related to traffic control and not provided for in this chapter shall not be displayed on CMS. FHWA proposes this additional language to promote uniformity in the use of CMS and to discourage the use CMS to display messages not provided for in the MUTCD, ensuring that the CMS adhere to the basic principles of an effective traffic control device that are stated in the existing provisions of Part 1.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change existing Option P2 to a Guidance and move the statement earlier in this section to clarify the types of messages to be used on CMS in support of the proposed Standard relocated from Section 2L.01.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a new Guidance statement recommending that CMS not be used in place of static guide sign messages except for blank- out type signs used to display regulatory, warning, and guidance information that routinely reoccurs but only on a parttime basis. In addition, only elements of a sign that are subject to change should be in an electronic display. FHWA proposes these changes to help ensure consistency in sign design by controlling the potential variability of information that should not change on a sign.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed with a minor revision for clarity to change the reference to “static guide signs” in the first sentence to “conventional signs”.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to delete Support Item D, messages pertaining to control at crossing situations, from the list of types of messages for which CMS are applicable. FHWA proposes this change, because “control at crossings” is not well understood and such messages would be covered under the other more general categories within the list, such as “Warning situations” or “Traffic regulations.”
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Support item D is deleted as proposed. In addition, item J is edited slightly to “variable destination guidance,” and based on comment, new items K and L are added for “supporting temporary traffic control” and “Active Traffic Management”, respectively.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change existing Guidance P3 to a Standard to require that agencies that have permanently installed or positioned CMS have a policy regarding their use and the display of all types of messages used on CMS. Such policies shall define the types of messages that would be allowed, the priority of messages, the syntax of messages, the timing of messages, and other important messaging elements to ensure messages displayed meet the basic principles that govern the design and use of traffic control devices in general and traffic signs in particular as provided for in the MUTCD.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Guidance P3 is changed to Standard as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes that State and local agencies that use CMS that are not permanently installed or positioned should develop and establish a similar policy. FHWA proposes these changes in order to ensure urgent and real-time traffic operational and safety messages developed to address varying roadway and traffic conditions are easily understood, timely, and relevant.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to include recommendations specific to the display of AMBER alerts, including limiting the length of messages, and details, such as description of persons, vehicles or license plate numbers.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a new Standard paragraph prohibiting other “alert” messages that are not related to traffic or travel conditions that are not otherwise permitted in P2. FHWA proposes this to emphasize that AMBER alert messages are a result of a statutory requirement and are the only “alert” exception to the statute that requires traffic control devices to be related to traffic control. FHWA also proposes to revise Support P4 to clarify examples of acceptable traffic safety campaign supporting and transportation-related messages.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add new Guidance and Standard paragraphs regarding the appropriate and allowable use of traffic safety campaign messages on CMS displays. FHWA proposes this new language to clarify that safety and transportation-related messages should be clear and direct, and meaningful to the road user on the roadway that the message is displayed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments suggesting information related to traffic safety campaign messages all be located in one section, the Guidance and Standard paragraphs pertaining to traffic safety campaign messages on CMS displays are consolidated in new Section 2L.07
Traffic Safety Campaign Messages.</p>

	<p>FHWA recommends that messages with obscure meaning, references to popular culture, that are intended to be humorous, or otherwise use nonstandard syntax, not be displayed because they can be misunderstood or understood only by a limited segment of road users and, therefore, degrade the overall effectiveness of the sign as an official traffic control device.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>
	
	<p>FHWA proposes in the Standard that only traffic safety campaign messages that are part of an active, coordinated safety campaign that uses other media forms as its primary means of outreach be displayed on CMS. Based on the widely varying views that have been expressed on the topic of uses of CMS and message content, including the use of unconventional syntax and humor, FHWA requests that commenters provide sufficient detail and explanation of how their position would maintain the uniformity and effectiveness of CMS for their intended purpose of displaying real-time traffic regulatory, warning, or guidance information. FHWA requests that commenters address, in particular, the use of CMS for messages outside the scope of traffic-related messages, such as those that are intended only to modify driver behavior, the frequency and extent of use for this purpose, and its overall effect on the efficacy of traffic messages when displayed. Specific references should be made to the proposed MUTCD text and the explanation provided in this document. In addition, FHWA requests that commenters provide supporting objective and empirical data, such as those from human factors evaluations, engineering studies, and similar non-subjective assessments.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Support, Standard, and Guidance statements regarding the use of messages related to homeland security and emergencies that affect traffic patterns, movement, or present other situations that are atypical. FHWA proposes these statements to provide provisions for messaging on CMS for such events while maintain the integrity of and respect for CMS as a traffic control device.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support, Standard, and Guidance statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add Guidance that safety campaigns using CMS should include coordinated enforcement efforts when penalties or enforcement warnings are part of the CMS message displayed to road users. FHWA proposes this to maintain the credibility of these signs and improve safety.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed in Section 2L.07.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="fr">
	<p><b>AMBER Alerts on CMS</b></p>
	<p>In Section 2L.02, the NPA proposed a new Guidance statement recommending that America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) alerts should not preempt messages related to traffic or travel conditions, should be as brief as possible, and should not include other information, such as detailed descriptions of persons, vehicles, or license plate numbers.</p>

	<p>Several State DOTs and the NCUTCD suggested that information regarding the vehicle, including the license plate, are essential pieces of information and are currently used for AMBER alert messaging. One State DOT shared its experience with using only a general vehicle description that resulted in generating an overwhelming number of 911 calls. Commenters indicated that more detailed information, such as the license plate number is necessary for AMBER alerts to be effective.</p>

	<p>In response to comments, FHWA removes the Guidance specifically discouraging the use of descriptions of persons, vehicles, or license plate numbers as part of AMBER alert messages on CMS in the final rule. Guidance is retained that AMBER alert messages should be kept as brief as possible to address the potential of overloading road users with detailed information and, when possible, use other sources to convey that detailed information associated with the alert. Also, FHWA retains the proposed Guidance that AMBER alerts should not preempt messages related to traffic or travel conditions to ensure road user have real-time changing traffic and travel conditions requiring immediate motorist response. The FHWA believes the final rule is responsive to commenters and promotes the appropriate use of CMS to enhance public safety, consistent with Section 11135 of BIL.</p>

	<p><b>Safety Messages on Changeable Message Signs</b></p>

	<p>In Chapter 2L, FHWA proposed several provisions in the NPA related to safety messages on CMS. The NPA included new Guidance and Standard paragraphs in Section 2L.02 regarding the appropriate and allowable use of traffic safety campaign messages on CMS displays. The FHWA proposed this new language to clarify that safety and transportation-related messages—which had been and would continue to be allowed—should be clear and direct, and meaningful to the road user on the roadway that the message is displayed. The FHWA recommended that messages with obscure meaning, references to popular culture, that are intended to be humorous, or otherwise use nonstandard syntax for a traffic control device, not be displayed because they can be misunderstood or understood only by a limited segment of road users and, therefore, degrade the overall effectiveness of the sign as an official traffic control device. The FHWA proposed a Standard that only traffic safety campaign messages that are part of an active, coordinated safety campaign that uses other media forms as its primary means of outreach be displayed on CMS, such that the CMS message would be a supplement to the overall campaign that employs other media and/or tools to promote the message.</p>

	<p>While a number of commenters expressed support for the proposed provisions on traffic safety messages on CMS, others expressed opposition and suggested that the provisions should be less restrictive. Several commenters suggested moving all information related to traffic safety messages to a single section. Many commenters expressed concern that messages outside of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)-developed enforcement campaign slogans would not be allowed under the proposed revision. While some commenters did request more flexibility in safety messaging and CMS use in general, many commenters supported the proposed provisions to help stem what they viewed as overuse or inappropriate uses of CMS. Some commenters believed that the NPA should explicitly restrict specific types of messages and even develop a standardized library of acceptable messages.</p>

	<p>In response to comments, FHWA places all information related to traffic safety campaign messages in Section 2L.07. In addition, as it was not the intent to restrict safety campaign messages only to those on the NHTSA Communications Calendar, FHWA revises the applicable Guidance provision so as not to imply that an agency is precluded from developing and displaying messages of its own traffic safety campaigns separate from the NHTSA campaigns.</p>

	<p>The provisions on message construction and content, as proposed, are largely consistent with past and current human factors research in the areas of driver information overload, comprehension, the general principles for effective traffic control devices, and, specifically, messaging on CMS. These considerations were also the basis for FHWA's 2021 policy memorandum on CMS  use that was developed in collaboration with NHTSA. The Guidance provisions, as adopted, can be deviated from based on engineering judgement. However, FHWA believes these are important considerations as not to diminish respect for the sign when used in other traffic-related scenarios for regulatory, warning, and guidance under prevailing conditions.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>298. FHWA proposes to change the title of existing Section
2L.04 to “Design Characteristics of Messages,” to describe better the content of the section.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The title of the section is changed as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Standard paragraph requiring portable CMS used as an arrow board with flashing or sequential display for a lane closure to conform with provisions in Section 6F.61. FHWA proposes this change for consistency of device operation used for the same application, because a CMS used in this manner is operating as an arrow board, which is allowed to have dynamic display.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed and the section references updated.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to add a new Standard paragraph requiring all message displays on CMS, whether for regulatory, warning, or guidance information on traffic operations, or for other allowable message types as defined in the section, follow the same design and display principles found in the MUTCD used for other traffic control signs, except as provided elsewhere in this chapter. FHWA proposes this Standard to promote uniformity in the display of CMS and maintaining its effectiveness as a traffic control device.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed with minor edits.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to provide Guidance that warning beacons should not be used on CMS for the purpose of drawing attention to certain types of messages over others, but instead should be limited to those messages that are critical to real-time conditions on a more frequent basis. FHWA proposes this provision to ensure that CMS maintain the same level of respect of road users expected of all traffic control devices at all times, regardless of message being displayed.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Guidance is adopted with revisions to clarify that CMS should be used predominately to display messages that are critical to real-time travel conditions.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Guidance P6 regarding CMS word message lettering heights to clarify what types of CMS the letter heights apply to, and to clarify that the provisions do not apply to blank- out signs.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is revised as proposed, and an Option statement added to indicate a CMS used to display a conventional sign may use the character size of the conventional sign being replicated.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Comments suggesting the width-to height ratio of sign characters should refer to NEMA standards and comments suggesting provisions for pixel pitch are out of scope of this rulemaking and will be considered in a future edition.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change existing Guidance P15 regarding legend color when there is a black background to a Standard for sign consistency since changeable message signs can accommodate multiple colors.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is changed to Standard as proposed, and based on comment, an exception added for CMS that use only yellow or amber LEDs to allow them to display a yellow or amber legend that does not match the background color used on a standard sign for that type of legend.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to delete the last sentence of Support P17 regarding newer technologies of CMS and add reference to a new figure that provides a comparative example of the effects of varying pixel densities.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to revise Guidance P18 to recommend where an LED matrix is used to form the changeable legend, signs with pixel spacing greater than 20mm should display only word legends, and no symbols or route shields. FHWA proposes this change based on a review of manufacturer products and visual inspections of the appearance of legends on these types of signs, which indicate that these signs do not provide adequate resolution to display symbols with sufficient clarity for road user instant recognition and therefore should only be use for word messages.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>299. In Section 2L.05 Message Length and Units of Information, FHWA proposes to revise Standard P4 to clarify that when a CMS contains more than one message phase, each phase shall be communicated so that the road user may understand each phase by itself regardless of the sequence in which it is read, and the message shall have the same meaning regardless of the sequence it is read. FHWA proposes this change, because it is important that road users be able to understand the intent of the message if they can only read one of the phases or when the phases are read in different order.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is revised as proposed with a minor edit. Based on comments, an Option is added to allow variance from the Standard on centered legends on signs such as travel time or variable rate toll displays.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete Standard P5 since the text is already covered in Section 2L.04.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is deleted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change Guidance P8 to an Option to clarify that adding additional CMS is an option available to agencies for displaying longer messages that would require more than two phases, which is the most number of phases allowed on a CMS.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is changed to Option as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to change and relocate Guidance P9 regarding abbreviations within a CMS message to a Standard. FHWA proposes this change because the provisions contained in the referenced Section are Standards.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is changed to Standard as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to add a Support paragraph that provides reference to two proposed new tables that list examples of message construction for CMS. FHWA proposes these tables to ensure that message recognition, comprehension, and effectiveness is maintained for all road users.</p>

	<p>302. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2L.08 Traffic Safety Campaign Messages.” In this new section, FHWA proposes Support, Guidance, and Standard paragraphs describing the display of traffic safety campaign messages as an ancillary use of CMS.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section is adopted as Section 2L.07 with revisions. Based on comments, this section consolidates all information related to traffic safety campaign messages in this Section. See Preamble of Federal Register for additional discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a Guidance paragraph recommending that traffic safety campaign messages be coordinated with the national safety campaigns on NHTSA’s communications calendar.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed in new Section
(now Section 2L.07).
</p>
	
	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes a Standard paragraph that requires traffic control messages to have primacy over traffic safety campaign messages. FHWA proposes this new Section to ensure that CMS be used only for their intended purpose and that traffic- related messages take precedence over other types of allowable messages.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed with a minor edit in new Section (now Section 2L.07).</p>
