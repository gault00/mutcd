    <h1>Chapter 2F. Toll Road Signs</h1>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>228. As part of the reorganization to improve usability of the MUTCD, FHWA proposes to include subchapter headings in Chapter 2F to organize sections into related groupings. FHWA proposes the following subchapters in Chapter 2F: General, Regulatory Signs, Warning Signs, and Guide Signs. FHWA proposes to include a list at the beginning of the section to assist users in finding the appropriate sections.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The reorganization of Chapter 2F with sub-chapter headings is adopted as proposed.</p>

    <h3 id="section2F01">Section 2F.01 Scope</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2F01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Toll highways are typically limited-access freeway or expressway facilities. A portion of or an entire route might be a toll highway, or a bridge, tunnel, or other crossing point might be the only toll portion of a highway<span class="text_added"> at which a toll is collected.</span>. A toll highway might be a conventional road. The general signing requirements for toll roads will depend on the type of facility and access (freeway, expressway, or conventional road). The provisions of Chapters 2D and 2E will generally apply for guide signs along the toll facility that direct road users within and off the facility where exit points and geometric configurations are not dependent specifically on the collection of tolls. The aspect of tolling and the presence of toll plazas or collection points necessitate additional considerations in the typical signing needs. The notification of the collection of tolls in advance of and at entry points to the toll highway also necessitate additional modifications to the typical signing.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2F01_para02">02</span><span class="support">The scope of this Section applies to a route or facility on which all lanes are tolled. Chapter 2G contains provisions for the signing of managed lanes within an otherwise non-toll facility that employ tolling or pricing as an operational strategy to manage congestion levels.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2F01_para03">03</span><span class="standard">Except where specifically provided in this Chapter, the provisions of other Chapters in Part 2 shall apply to toll roads.</span></p>

	<p>229. In Section 2F.02, FHWA proposes to retitle the section “Sizes of Toll Road Signs and Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) System Pictographs” to reflect the proposed relocation of material from existing Section 2F.04 to this section.

<div class="npa">
	<p>233. In Sections 2F.06 through 2F.09, FHWA proposes to add the Take Ticket (W9–6e) Advance Warning sign, Take Ticket (W9–6bP, W9–6gP) advance warning plaque, Stop Ahead Take Ticket (W9–6f) warning sign, and Stop Ahead Take Ticket (W9–6hP) warning plaque, respectively. FHWA proposes these new signs and plaques to provide practitioners with a standard sign for use on those facilities where tickets are issued to determine the length of travel for assessing toll fees. In Sections 2F.06 through 2F.09, FHWA also proposes to delete the last sentence of the Standard requiring that the legend PAY TOLL shall be replaced with a suitable legend such as TAKE TICKET where road users entering a toll ticket facility are issued a toll ticket. In Sections 2F.06 through 2F.08, FHWA also proposes to add Guidance that a Take Ticket Advance Warning sign should be installed overhead at approximately 1 mile and 1⁄2 mile in advance of mainline toll plazas to provide sufficient advance warning to road users of this required action.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted with an Option added to
Section 2F.07 to describe the use of the Pay Toll (W9-6dP) plaque. In addition, the Standard and associated Option are deleted in Section 2F.09, because they do not apply the plaques being discussed in that section, and instead, clarifying language is added to the existing Option statement in paragraph 1 regarding the use of the Stop Ahead Pay Toll (W9-6cP) plaque. Although one commenter suggested that “Take Ticket” signs are obsolete, FHWA adopts the proposed language because some agencies do still use tickets.

FHWA proposes this change to provide agencies design flexibility where the plaque is used above a narrow- width guide sign. FHWA also proposes to recommend the Exit Number Plaque, if used, to be installed above the LAST EXIT BEFORE TOLL plaque for numbered exits. FHWA proposes this change to reiterate and clarify the existing requirements in Chapter 2E for the position of the Exit Number plaque. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>236. In Section 2F.12 (existing Section 2F.13) Toll Facility and Toll Plaza Guide Signs—General, FHWA proposes to add an Option to allow a State Toll Route system sign to be used in lieu of the State Route sign in combination with the TOLL warning plaque. FHWA proposes this change to allow those States that have developed a unique Route Sign design for tolled State highways to continue to use those types of signs whose designs conform to the prescribed criteria, rather than requiring a separate auxiliary sign. FHWA also proposes to add a Standard statement requiring State Toll Route signs to incorporate the word TOLL into its design using the same letter height, legend, background colors, and overall plaque dimensions specified for the W16–20P plaque. FHWA proposes this change to maintain uniform legibility criteria for either method. In addition, FHWA proposes to supplement an existing Standard statement prohibiting the modification of Interstate, Off- Interstate, and U.S. Route signs for tolled facilities. FHWA proposes this change to maintain uniformity of these signs because they apply to national systems. FHWA proposes this change as a conforming edit, which would not change the existing underlying requirement, as modification of these signs has never been allowed. FHWA also proposes to modify existing Standard P20 to require, rather than allow as an Option, the incorporation of the Toll Taker (M4–17) symbol panel in signs for attended lanes at toll plazas. In concert with this change, FHWA also proposes changing the Standard for word messages such as FULL SERVICE, CASH, CHANGE, or RECEIPTS to an Option to supplement the required symbol panel. FHWA proposes this change to standardize and use symbols in place of word messages where a symbol has been developed that provides at least equivalent levels of comprehension, legibility, and recognition, based on relevant research (https://www.pooledfund.org/details/study/281).</p>
	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to add a Standard statement requiring the use of an Overhead-Arrow-Per-Lane Guide sign in advance of a location where the mainline lanes split to separate traffic entering Open- Road ETC lanes from lanes entering a toll plaza where other methods of payment are accepted and an option lane is provided at the split. FHWA proposes this standard to be consistent with the use of Overhead- Arrow-Per Lane Guide signs in Chapter 2E where there is a split in the highway with an option lane.
</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed, except Standard P5 is revised in response to comment to indicate that the black legend on yellow background TOLL panel is not required on Exit Gore or destination guide signs (D1 series). The final rule also includes several new figures to illustrate signing to a toll road.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Comments were also received recommending the deletion of the Standard statement and associated figures on the use of Overhead Arrow-per-Lane signs with a modified bifurcated arrow design. The sign and new arrow design is for a roadway split with an option lane at a tolling location separating open-road tolling from toll booths. The commenter recommended deletion until such time as research on these signs is complete and evaluated. FHWA retains the standard and figure but has reconsidered the height of the bifurcated arrow on the sign in the figure. FHWA believes the slightly modified bifurcated arrow design better depicts the roadway alignment and the fact that the split in the roadway rejoins past the tolling point and does so without compromising the proven benefits of Overhead Arrow-per-Lanes signs in depicting roadway split situations.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>238. In Section 2F.17 Guide Signs for Entrances to ETC Account-Only Facilities, FHWA proposes to relocate and modify an Option statement from existing Section 2F.18 to permit a separate information sign displaying the route number, TOLL warning panel, and the legend NO CASH within the sequence of the advance guide signs on the approach to the entrance to an ETC Account-Only facility, which is already depicted in existing Figure 2F–6. FHWA proposes this change to provide agencies flexibility to use additional advance signing if needed. FHWA also proposes an Option to allow the Exit Gore signs for entrance ramps to ETC Account-Only facilities to incorporate the pictograph of the ETC payment system with the word ONLY in the header panel or plaque. FHWA proposes this change to allow agencies to reinforce that an ETC account is required to use the facility.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments suggesting that the proposed titles for Sections 2F.17 and 2F.18 were very similar and could lead to confusion, the two sections are combined into one section in the final rule, titled, “Section 2F.17 Guide Signs for Entrances to Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) Only Facilities.” The final rule includes an additional Option paragraph allowing the display of ETC account pictographs when more than one ETC account program is acceptable for toll payment. The final rule also includes a revised Standard statement indicating that facilities that do not require registration in an ETC toll account program are to include information on accepted toll payment methods only on separate information guide signs stating TOLL BILLED BY MAIL ONLY or TOLL BILLED BY MAIL OR [ETC Account Pictograph], if the facility also accepts payments from registered users of an ETC account program.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>239. FHWA proposes to add two new sections numbered and titled, “Section 2F.18 Guide Signs for Entrances to ETC Only Facilities” and “Section 2F.19 Guide Signs for ETC-Only Entrance Ramps to Non-Toll Highway” that contain provisions related to guide signs on facilities that are electronically tolled but do not require an ETC account. FHWA proposes to add these sections because of the increasing use of ETC Only facilities. The proposed new provisions are intended to provide consistent and uniform signing, much of which is already depicted in existing figures within this Chapter.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Proposed Section 2F.18 is combined with Section 2F.17 as described above.

	<div class="npa">
	<p>240. In proposed new Section 2F.18, FHWA proposes to include a new Standard regarding signs used to identify ETC-Only facilities that collect tolls by post- travel billing of registered vehicle owners through postal mail, including if an ETC account program registration is also accepted. In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to add an Option allowing the addition of a plaque with the legend NO CASH on these signs. FHWA also proposes to include an Option statement providing flexibility to display pictographs for other accepted ETC toll programs on separate information signs if the post-travel billing program also allows payment through those ETC accounts without restriction in the agencies’ primary ETC program. FHWA also proposes to add an Option statement for flexibility regarding signs that may be used to let motorist know if a surcharge is added to the toll amount for those not registered in toll account program.</p>
