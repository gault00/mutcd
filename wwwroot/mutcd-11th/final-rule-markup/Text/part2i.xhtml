	<div class="npa">
	<p>273. In Section 2I.03 General Service Signs for Freeways and Expressways, FHWA proposes a new Guidance paragraph recommending the use of D9-18 or D9-18a signs for numbered interchanges.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is revised in response to comment to clarify that where General Service signs are used along routes with exit numbering, the General Service sign should include the exit number within the sign face below the services.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">In the Guidance provision listing eligibility criteria for General Services signs a public telephone is removed from items A, B, and C, in response to comments suggesting public telephones are not needed due to the availability of cell phones. While no longer recommended in the MUTCD, agencies may continue to consider policies that include public telephone as a criterion based on the availability of cellular service in particular geographic regions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">Comments reflected the increasing shift on alternative fuel vehicles and specifically EVs by requesting additional flexibilities to include EV charging services signs. The FHWA agrees with these comments and added several provisions to ensure adequate flexibility is available to sign for EV charging services.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Support and Option statements regarding motorist expectations for facilities providing alternative fuels, as well as policy criteria for alternative fuel vehicles to address issues specific to alternative fuel vehicles.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The Support provision is adopted as proposed. To provide consistency with other areas of the Manual, the Option statement is changed to Guidance to recommend policy criteria to take into account needs, convenience and safety of alternative fueled vehicle users.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to change the Standard requiring sign space be left blank for future services to a Guidance to provide agencies with greater flexibility based on the agency’s knowledge of local conditions.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change to Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>274. In Section 2I.04 retitled, “Interstate Oasis Signing (D5–12 Series),” FHWA proposes to delete the Guidance recommending that names or logos of businesses designated as Interstate Oasis not be included in the Interstate Oasis sign and instead proposes to add a new Option permitting the name of the business designated as an Interstate Oasis to be provided below the Interstate Oasis legend on the D5–12 sign if Specific Service signing is not used at the interchange. FHWA proposes this change based on experience with signing for the Interstate Oasis areas and recognizing that it may be appropriate to include business names.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete Guidance text indicating that Interstate Oasis signs should have a white legend with a letter height of at least 10 inches and a white border on a blue background as the designs of these signs are standardized and must comply with the existing provisions of Chapter 2A.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes to delete the Interstate Oasis symbol panel, along with the related Standard, based on poor comprehension of the symbol and the fact that no State currently uses the symbol.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to add a new Interstate Oasis Directional (D5–12b) sign to provide road users the direction and distance to the Interstate Oasis from an exit ramp.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>281. In Section 2I.14 (existing Section 2I.11), retitled, “Carpool and Ridesharing Signing (D12–2),” FHWA proposes to revise the existing Standard to add a maximum horizontal dimension of 30 inches for consistency with similar applications to maintain primacy of other more critical signs.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to remove the existing Guidance pertaining to legend, border, and background colors as the design requirements of this sign are standardized and must comply with the existing provisions of Chapter 2A.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The changes to Section 2I.14 are adopted as proposed. One commenter suggested adding an Option to allow use of Web sites and telephone numbers only for account-only electronic tolling program information, especially those associated with HOV lanes, similar to the use of Web sites and phone numbers allowed on Carpool and Ridesharing signing. FHWA will consider this for a future revision.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>282. FHWA proposes to add a new section numbered and titled, “Section 2I.15 Signing for Truck Parking Availability (D9–16b through D9–16e),” with Option, Standard, Support, and Guidance statements, as well as two new figures, related to the use of Truck Parking Availability General Service signs that may be used to display the number of available truck parking spaces at roadside areas such as rest areas, welcome centers, and weigh stations, and at facilities off a highway that are open to the public and provide parking for commercial vehicles.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">New Section 2I.15 Signing for Truck Parking Availability (D9-16b through D9-16e) is adopted as proposed. Commenters suggest allowing the term “LOW” rather than “FULL” in the Standard for displaying availability on truck parking signs; however, the term “FULL” is retained for a more accurate depiction of the situation. Commenters also suggest revising the Guidance to allow a greater distance than 60 miles between the sign location and parking facilities; however, 60 miles is retained as engineering judgement can be applied where unique conditions warrant deviation from the Guidance.</p>
