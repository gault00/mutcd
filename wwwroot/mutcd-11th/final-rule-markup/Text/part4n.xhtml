	<p>434. In new “Section 4N.03 Operation of Emergency- Vehicle Hybrid Beacons,” consisting of paragraphs from existing Section 4G.04, FHWA proposes to add a Standard requiring the beacon faces to display flashing yellow signal indications to each approach on the major street if placed into flashing mode by a conflict monitor or manual switch. FHWA proposes this change for consistency with requirements for traffic control signals.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add an Option to allow an emergency vehicle hybrid beacon in close proximity to an active grade crossing to be preempted.</p>
	<p class="fr-disp">The change is adopted as a Guidance rather than an Option.
