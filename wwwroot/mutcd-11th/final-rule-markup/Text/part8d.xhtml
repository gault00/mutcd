    <h1>Chapter <span class="text_deleted">8C</span><span class="text_added">8D</span>. Flashing-Light Signals, <span class="text_added">Automatic </span>Gates, and Traffic Control Signals</h1>

    <h3 id="section8D01">Section <span class="text_deleted">8C.01</span><span class="text_added">8D.01</span> Introduction</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>558. In Section 8D.01 (existing Section 8C.01) Introduction, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending that when the automatic gate is in its upright position, no portion of the physical features of flashing-light signals and gates should be closer than 12 feet from the center of the nearest track. FHWA proposes this language to provide adequate vertical clearance in the vicinity of the tracks and to formalize the dimensions shown in Figure 8D–2 (existing Figure 8C–2).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed Guidance statement is not adopted because it could conflict with the Standard statement that precedes this where the railroad company, transit agency, or regulatory agency permit automatic gates to be closer than 12 feet from the rail. The 12-foot dimension is also deleted in Figure 8D-2.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes to eliminate the Support statement in existing Paragraph 15 regarding LRT typical speeds through semi-exclusive and mixed-use alignment because the statement does not add useful information.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In concert with this change, FHWA proposes to relocate existing Paragraph 16 to the beginning of the Section with the other Support statements.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The relocation is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Editorial changes are also adopted to replace references to an engineering study with references to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Section 8A.03 and 8A.05.</p>

	<p>559. In Section 8D.02 (existing Section 8C.02) Flashing-Light Signals, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement, and an accompanying Support statement regarding the placement of the Number of Tracks plaque with respect to the flashing-light backgrounds, as well as the Crossbuck sign.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance and Support statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes adding a Guidance paragraph recommending that if flashing-light signals are used, at least one pair of flashing lights should be provided for each approach lane of the roadway. FHWA proposes this Guidance to provide uniform flashing light signals across the roadway.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes three Guidance paragraphs to provide text that supports the dimensions for placement and mounting shown in Figure 8D–1 (existing Figure 8C–1).</p>
	
	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraphs are adopted as proposed with an editorial revision clarifying that the mounting height should be measured from the center of the flashing light.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes Guidance paragraphs recommending that where the storage distance for vehicles approaching a grade crossing is less than a design vehicle length, the Diagnostic Team should consider providing additional flashing-light signals aligned toward the movement turning toward the grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>
	
	<p>FHWA also recommends that the Diagnostic Team consider the use of additional flashing-light signals to provide supplemental warning to pedestrians. FHWA proposes these changes to provide additional warning of the grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes to delete the last Standard statement in this section, because the provisions are covered elsewhere.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>560. In Section 8D.03 (existing Section 8C.04) Automatic Gates, FHWA proposes a Standard requiring the width of the retroreflective sheeting on the front of the gate arm to be at least 4 inches. FHWA proposes this addition to provide an adequate width of material for visibility.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted with revisions to clarify that the 4-inch dimension is applicable for the first 32 feet of the gate arm. An additional Standard is added for gate arms longer than 32 feet, which shall have sheeting that is a minimum of 2 inches. This additional Standard is in response to comments to address gates that are tapered beyond 32 feet, which is done to reduce wind loads.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard statement requiring that except for the continuously illuminated light at the tip of the gate, the left-most flashing gate light in each additional pair of lights flashes simultaneously with the left hand light of the flashing-light signals and the right-most flashing gate light in each additional pair of lights flashes simultaneously with the right-hand light of the flashing-light signals. FHWA proposes this addition to provide uniformity in flashing patterns between the flashing-light signals and the flashing lights on the gate.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed. The proposed Guidance statement is deleted in response to comments because it could conflict with the Standard statement in Section 8D.01 where the railroad company, transit agency, or regulatory agency permit automatic gates to be closer than 10 feet from the rail. The 10-foot dimension is also deleted in Figure 8D-2.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a Guidance paragraph with recommendations for the location of the tip of the automatic gate arm when it is in the down position relative to the center of the nearest track. FHWA proposes this addition to support the dimensions shown in Figure 8D–2 (existing Figure 8C–2).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance paragraph is adopted with revisions that delete dimensions that are not relevant to the traffic control device. These dimensions are also deleted in Figure 8D-1.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes Guidance paragraphs with recommendations for the length, height, and position of the automatic gate arm. FHWA proposes these additions to support the dimensions shown in Figure
8D–1 (existing Figure 8C–1).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A Guidance statement is also adopted regarding median length because this is a factor in the effectiveness of automatic gates and a similar Guidance statement is contained in Section 8D.05.</p>

	<p>561. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled,
“Section 8D.04 Use of Active Traffic Control Systems at LRT Grade Crossings” that replaces existing Sections 8C.03 and 8C.05.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new section is adopted with reordered paragraphs to improve the understanding of the section. Editorial revisions are adopted to delete references to LRT operating speed consistent with the Support statement regarding LRT speed in Section 8D.01.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes active traffic control system Standards for highway-LRT grade crossings based on the maximum operating speed of the LRT vehicles. Where the maximum LRT operating speed exceeds
40 mph, active traffic control systems with automatic gates would be required. Where the maximum LRT operating speed is greater than 25 mph but is less than 40 mph, active traffic control systems would be required and automatic gates would be optional. FHWA proposes this change based on the safety experience of modern LRT systems and to replace paragraphs that were previously in existing Section 8C.03.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statements are adopted with editorial revisions to improve the clarity of the statements.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">A new Option statement is adopted to clarify that the Diagnostic Team may still recommend automatic gates at LRT grade crossings where LRT speeds do not exceed 40 mph.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Guidance statement with recommendations for active traffic control systems where LRT operating speeds are less than 25 mph unless an engineering study determines that passive devices would provide adequate control.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted with an editorial revision to replace the reference to an engineering study with a reference to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Section 8A.03 and 8A.05.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Guidance statement with a recommendation not to use a traffic control signal alone at locations that are not intersections and LRT speeds are above 20 mph.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted with revisions to clarify the intent of the statement is to disallow the use of traffic control signals instead of automatic gates for LRT grade crossings that are not at an intersection and where LRT speeds exceed 20 mph.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>562. In Section 8D.05 (existing Section 8C.06), retitled, “Exit Gate and Four-Quadrant Gate Systems,” FHWA proposes to add Support paragraphs to clarify the difference between Exit Gate systems and Four-Quadrant Systems.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Support paragraphs are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a Standard statement to require the queue clearance time be long enough to permit the exit gate arm to lower after a design vehicle of maximum length is clear of the minimum track clearance distance where a Four-Quadrant Gate system is present. This proposed Standard is necessary to ensure that vehicles can clear the tracks safely without becoming entrapped between the gates on the tracks while a train is approaching.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>In addition, FHWA proposes to add a Guidance statement recommending that exit gates be independently controlled for each direction of roadway traffic. FHWA proposes these additions to provide consistency with industry practice.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Lastly, FHWA proposes to delete existing Paragraph 17 because this recommendation resulted in exit gates being located significantly further from the grade crossing than the entrance gates.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The deletion is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Editorial revisions are adopted to proposed P1, P10, and P18 to replace the references to an engineering study with references to the Diagnostic Team, consistent with the Standards in Section 8A.03 and 8A.05.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, a Support statement is also adopted to define Minimum Warning Time. This definition was deleted from Part 1 in the NPA and this term is only used in Part 8, therefore the definition is appropriate to include in Part 8.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Finally, Editorial revisions are adopted to Figure 8D-2 to be consistent with the text edits in Chapter 8D.</p>

	<h3 id="section8D09">Section 8D.09 Preemption of Highway Traffic Signals at or Near Grade Crossings</h3>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>565. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 8D.10 Preemption of Highway Traffic Signals at or Near Grade Crossings.” Several of the paragraphs in the proposed new section are from existing Section 8C.09.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The new section is renumbered to Section 8D.09 and is adopted with revisions as described below.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standards, Guidance, Options, and Support statements regarding traffic signal preemption at grade crossings. FHWA proposes this new material to provide consistency with the changes in the industry resulting from the investigation into the causes of the fatal train/school bus crash in Fox River Grove, Illinois (<a href ="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR9602.pdf">https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/HAR9602.pdf</a>).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted with clarifying revisions.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes new Support statements about the systems that are involved in preemption. FHWA proposes the change to provide agencies with additional background information about preemption.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Support statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes changes to Guidance to include additional measures for situations where the traffic signal is located farther than 200 feet from the grade crossing. FHWA proposes the change to provide additional information to agencies to improve safety at grade crossing that do not have preemption.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements in P4 are adopted with revisions to clarify that they are applicable to traffic control signals, pedestrian hybrid beacons, and emergency vehicle hybrid beacons.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance paragraphs to provide additional recommendations for the use of active grade crossing warning systems near traffic signals, the use of automatic gates at traffic signals with preemption, and the annual inspection of the preemption operation. FHWA proposes the changes to reflect industry practices resulting from investigation of train/vehicle crashes.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements in proposed P5 and P7 are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement in proposed P6 is adopted with revisions to provide clearer language regarding the distance when an active grade crossing warning system should be installed. The 200-foot dimension is also consistent with Standards and Guidance statements regarding preemption in the rest of Chapter 8D.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes a new Standard paragraph that requires preemption where traffic signal faces are located within 50 feet of a grade crossing that has flashing-light signals. FHWA proposes this change to avoid display of traffic signal indications that conflict with the flashing-light signal system.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement in proposed P8 is revised to a Support statement because inspection of the grade crossing system is a best practice and there is not a regulatory basis for a specified frequency of inspections.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, the Standard paragraph is adopted with revisions for the signal displays to be determined by the Diagnostic Team rather than permitting only RED indications. The reference to the Diagnostic Team is more consistent with the rest of Part 8 and avoids potential misapplication of the Standard.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Support and Option statements to provide additional information about double break and supervised circuits. FHWA proposes this change to provide practitioners with information to make the preemption fail-safe.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Support and Option statements are adopted with a revision to delete the reference to busway. This change is proposed because NPA Section 8A.13 regarding busways is deleted.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance statements to provide recommendations for locations with track detection circuits at passive grade crossings and left turn movements at a preempted traffic signal downstream from a grade crossing. FHWA proposes the changes to provide agencies with recommendations for situations that are not addressed in the existing MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance and Support statements to describe the considerations and recommendations for application of simultaneous and advance preemption. FHWA proposes these changes to provide practitioners with more information to improve consistency in the application of preemption.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements are adopted with editorial revisions to clarify the intended meaning. The Support statement is not adopted because it is unnecessary and does not improve practitioners’ understanding of the Guidance statements.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standard statements regarding the end of the track clearance interval. FHWA proposes these changes to prohibit the track clearance interval from being terminated too early in situations when there is variability in train approach times.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement is adopted as proposed. FHWA also adopts a new Support statement to identify additional resources regarding preemption time variability.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance statement recommending the use of advanced preemption with exit gates. FHWA proposes this change because additional preemption time is needed for the safe operation of the exit gate system.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance statements recommending the ability of traffic signal equipment to restart or reservice preemption requests. FHWA proposes this change to provide consistent preemption operation where train movements may stop or start on the approach to the grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard statement to prohibit the flashing mode of a traffic signal from beginning until rail traffic has entered the grade crossing. FHWA proposes this change to prevent road user confusion that could result in stopping on the tracks.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statement is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes a new Standard paragraph to require evaluation of the priority of preemption calls when both boats and trains operate at a grade crossing. FHWA proposes this change to require agencies to resolve competing preemption requests.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard is adopted with editorial revisions to clarify what the Diagnostic Team is intended to determine when there are multiple conflicting preemption calls.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Finally, a new Option statement in proposed P12 is adopted to provide flexibility for the Diagnostic Team to determine the preemption time where train switching or restarts occur close to a grade crossing with preemption.</p>

	<p>566. In Section 8D.11 (existing Section 8B.08), retitled, “Movements Prohibited During Preemption,” FHWA proposes new Guidance and Option statements that prohibit movements towards a grade crossing using traffic signal indications and blank-out signs. FHWA proposes this change to provide more detailed recommendations and information to agencies for the prohibition of permissive-only turn movements, protected-only turn movements and straight-through movements towards a grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is renumbered to Section 8D.10. The Guidance statements are adopted with revisions to differentiate the recommendations for permissive-only, protected/permissive and protected-only turn movements. The recommendation to use R3-1a or R3-2a blank-out signs is adopted because it addresses the issue of right-turn vehicles stopped in a through lane when the signal is green. The intent of the Guidance is to address or reduce undesirable driver behavior when this occurs, and the guidance is consistent with NTSB recommendation H-13-041. Agencies still have the ability to use R3-1, R3-2, or R3-27 if they document the engineering reasons to not follow the Guidance.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance statements for the recommended use of LRT-activated blank-out signs. FHWA proposes this change to improve consistency in the application of the signs.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance statements are adopted with editorial revisions to improve to improve the clarity of the statements.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes a revised Standard that requires blank-out signs used in preemption be activated only when the preemption is active. FHWA proposes this change to improve the consistent operation of the signs.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The revised Standard is adopted with editorial revisions for clarity and accuracy.</p>

	<p>567. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 8D.12 Pre-Signals at or Near Grade Crossings.” Several of the paragraphs in this proposed new section are from existing Section 8C.09.
</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is renumbered to Section 8D.11 and is adopted with revisions as described below.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed first sentence of the Support statement in P3 is relocated from proposed Section 8D.13 to Section 8D.11 because the statement is applicable to pre-signals rather than queue cutter signals.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes revised and new Standards that require red signal indications to be displayed during preemption. FHWA proposes the change to prevent conflicting indications between the pre-signal and the grade crossing flashing-light signal system.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The changes are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Guidance paragraph to recommend measures at downstream traffic signals. FHWA proposes this change to reduce vehicles queuing from a downstream signal through a grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The proposed new Guidance paragraph P6 is revised to a Support statement in P4 because commentors noted that the list of conditions is not all inclusive and the Guidance statement does not improve consistency.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes revised and new Options for the green interval. FHWA proposes this change to provide agencies with additional information and flexibility in the operation of a pre-signal.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard statement to define the calculation of the queue clearance time. FHWA proposes the change to improve safety of road users by ensuring the queue clearance time is long enough to clear vehicles out of the grade crossing after the pre-signal indications turn red.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">In response to comments, the Standard statement is revised to Guidance because it addresses operations and there could be situations where the Standard could not be met.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance paragraphs to provide recommendations for indications overturn lanes that extend from a downstream intersection through a pre-signal. FHWA proposes the change to avoid road user confusion between indications at a pre-signal and a downstream traffic signal and based on Official Ruling No. 8(09)–19(I) (<a href ="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_19.htm">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_19.htm</a>).</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance is adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">Based on comments, proposed Paragraph 6 is not adopted because it was determined the guidance was not clear, it could be applied to all movements, and it was not inclusive of all options that could be considered.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standards and Support paragraphs that require agencies to use specific indications at a pre-signal. FHWA proposes the change to improve safety by discouraging road users from inadvertently turning onto railroad or LRT tracks.</p>

	<div class="npa">
	<p>568. FHWA proposes a new section numbered and titled, “Section 8D.13 Queue Cutter Signals at or Near Grade Crossings” for the placement and implementation of queue cutter signals near grade crossings.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The section is renumbered to Section 8D.12 and is adopted with revisions as described below.</p>

	<p>FHWA proposes new Support and Option statements to provide information about the application, and operation of queue cutter signals. FHWA proposes the change to allow agencies explicitly to install queue cutter signals which are not addressed in the existing MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Support statement in the first sentence of P4 is relocated to Section 8D.12 because the statement is applicable to pre-signals rather than queue cutter signals.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes a new Standard paragraph that requires agencies to use specific indications at a queue cutter signal. FHWA proposes the change to improve safety by discouraging road users from inadvertently turning onto railroad or LRT tracks.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Standard statements are adopted with revisions to clarify the signal indications to be used where lanes are controlled separately versus where lanes are controlled together. Also, a new Option statement is adopted to permit CIRCULAR GREEN signal indications where all adjacent lanes at the pre-signal are controlled together to address commentors that identified existing pre-signals that are operating safely with circular indications.</p>
	
	<p>FHWA also proposes new Options for the locations of queue cutter indications. FHWA proposes the changes to provide agencies with flexibility to install indications where they will be most visible and effective.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Option statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance and Options for signing associated with the queue cutter. FHWA proposes the changes to provide agencies with flexibility to install signing that discourages road users from stopping in the grade crossing.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance and Option statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance and Options for the operation of queue cutter signals. FHWA proposes the change to provide recommendations for the safe and effective operation of the signal.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance in proposed P14 is revised to an Option because the statement does not contain a recommendation and the intent of the statement is consistent with an Option.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance in proposed P15 is revised to improve the clarity of the recommendation.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standards that require interconnection and preemption of a queue cutter signal. FHWA proposes the change to require uniform application and to prevent conflicting or confusing displays by the queue cutter signal and flashing-light signal system.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">See Preamble of Federal Register for discussion of this item.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Guidance and Support paragraphs to provide recommendations and information for indications overturn lanes that extend from a downstream intersection through a queue cutter. FHWA proposes the change to avoid road user confusion between indications at a pre-signal and a downstream traffic signal.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Guidance and Support statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<p>FHWA also proposes new Standards and Support statements to require additional measures for situations where a turn lane from a downstream intersection is controlled separately from through movements at a queue cutter signal. FHWA proposes the change to avoid road user confusion when different indications are displayed in adjacent lanes at a queue cutter signal and based on Official Ruling No. 8(09)–19(I) (<a href ="https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_19.htm">https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/interpretations/8_09_19.htm</a>).</p>

A new Option statement is adopted to permit CIRCULAR GREEN signal indications where all adjacent lanes at the pre-signal are controlled together to address commentors that identified existing pre-signals that are operating safely with circular indications.</p>

	<p>Finally, FHWA proposes new Support statements that provides information differentiating a queue cutter signal and a queue jump signal. FHWA proposes the change to prevent confusion by users of the MUTCD.</p>

	<p class="fr-disp">The Support statements are adopted as proposed.</p>

	<div class="fr">The NPA included a compliance date of 10 years for evaluation and installation of appropriate treatments), including preemption, movement prohibition, pre-signals, or queue cutter signals, for highway traffic signals located at or near grade crossings. Commenters indicated that the costs to evaluate and implement these treatments at highway traffic signals can be significant and may not align with  the agency's other priorities. Commenters also pointed out that the number of impacted locations varies greatly by State creating a significant challenge for some States to meet the proposed compliance date. Comments suggested that devices should be brought into compliance through the systematic replacement and upgrade of traffic control devices and not subject to a compliance date. This final rule adopts the compliance date for Sections 8D.09 through 8D.12 with revisions to require only an assessment and determination of appropriate treatment to reach compliance at specific locations. Agencies will be granted flexibility to determine the schedule for installation of improvements based on availability of funding and other safety priorities through the systematic replacement and upgrade of traffic control devices as currently prescribed in the MUTCD for other traffic control devices.</div>

FHWA proposes these changes to improve consistency in the use of LRT signal indications.</p>
