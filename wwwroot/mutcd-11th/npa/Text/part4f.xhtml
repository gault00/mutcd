      <li>Separate left-turn signal face – This type of signal face controls only the left-turn movement and cannot serve as one of the two required primary signal faces for the adjacent movement (usually the through movement) because it displays signal indications that are applicable only to the left-turn movement. <span class="text_added">This type of signal face is used only for an approach that has an exclusive left-turn lane(s). </span>If a separate left-turn signal face is mounted overhead at the intersection, it is positioned over the extension of the <span class="text_added">exclusive </span>left-turn lane.
