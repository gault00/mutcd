	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E01_para04">04</span><span class="support">Figure 8E-1 illustrates the difference between a pathway grade crossing and a sidewalk grade crossing. A pathway is frequently placed in its own right-of-way on an alignment that is independent of any roadway. If a pathway is built parallel to the roadway, it is physically separated from the roadway by an open space or barrier such that the traffic control devices for the roadway grade crossing do not exert an influence over or provide adequate warning to pathway users. A sidewalk runs parallel to a roadway within the highway right-of-way and is close enough to the edge of the roadway's traveled way that the traffic control devices for the roadway grade crossing can frequently exert an influence over or provide adequate warning to pathway users. Pathways are typically used by both pedestrians and bicyclists, whereas sidewalks are typically used only by pedestrians.</span><span class="change_noted">Added to improve clarity and to support Figure 8E-1</span></p>

The casters of wheelchairs and the wheels of bicycles could fall into and might be constrained in the flangeway gap at a skewed crossing. The flangeway gap is typically 2.5 inches at LRT grade crossings and 3 inches at railroad grade crossings.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para05">05</span><span class="support">It is desirable that pathways and sidewalks be designed such that they maintain a relatively consistent horizontal alignment and profile from the nearest rail to the detectable warning (if present), from the nearest rail to the stop line (if present), or within 12 feet from the nearest rail, whichever distance is longer, on each approach to the crossing. Providing a pedestrian refuge area in advance of the stop line or the detectable warning surface so that pedestrians have a place to wait while rail traffic approaches and occupied the crossing can be beneficial to pedestrian safety.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para06">06</span><span class="support">When designing new sidewalk grade crossings, placing the sidewalk outside of the area occupied by grade crossing traffic control devices for vehicular traffic is desirable (see Figures 8E-2 and 8E-3). This includes making sure that the counterweights and support arms for the automatic gates for vehicular traffic do not obstruct the sidewalk when the gate is fully lowered.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para07">07</span><span class="support">Additional information regarding the design and alignment of pathways and sidewalks is contained in the "Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guide for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG)" (see Section 1A.05).</span></p>
