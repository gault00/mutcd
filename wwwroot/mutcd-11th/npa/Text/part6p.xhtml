While not every situation is addressed, the information illustrated can generally be adapted to a broad range of conditions. In many instances, an appropriate TTC plan is achieved by combining features from various typical applications. For example, work at an intersection might present a near-side work zone for one street and a far-side work zone for the other street. These treatments are found in two different typical applications, while a third typical application shows how to handle pedestrian crosswalk closures. For convenience in using the typical application diagrams, <a href="part6b.xhtml#table6B01">Tables 6<span class="text_deleted">C</span><span class="text_added">B</span>-1</a> and <a href="part6b.xhtml#table6B04">6<span class="text_deleted">C</span><span class="text_added">B</span>-4</a> are reproduced in this Chapter as <a href="#table6P05">Tables <span class="text_deleted">6H-3</span><span class="text_added">6P-5</span></a> and <a href="#table6P04"><span class="text_deleted">6H-4</span><span class="text_added">6P-4</span></a>, respectively.</span></p>

    <span class="text_deleted"><p><span class="support">Procedures for establishing TTC zones vary with such conditions as road configuration, location of the work, work activity, duration of work, road user volumes, road vehicle mix (buses, trucks, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles), and road user speeds.</span></p><span class="change_noted">Deleted; redundant with new Section 6B.01</span></span>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6P01_para02">02</span><span class="support">In general, the procedures illustrated represent minimum solutions for the situations depicted. Except for the notes (which are clearly classified using headings as being Standard, Guidance, Option, or Support), the information presented in the typical applications can generally be regarded as Guidance.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span></p>

    <ol class="support">
      <li>This application addresses one of several uses for movable barriers (see <a href="part6m.xhtml#section6M02">Section <span class="text_deleted">6F.85</span><span class="text_added">6M.02</span></a>) in highway work zones. In this example, one side of a 6-lane divided highway is closed to perform the work operation, and vehicular traffic is carried in both directions on the remaining 3-lane roadway by means of a median crossover.<br/> To accommodate unbalanced peak-period vehicular traffic volumes, the direction of travel in the center lane is switched to the direction having the greater volume, with the transfer typically being made twice daily. Thus, there are four vehicular traffic phases described as follows: 

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Phase A-two travel lanes northbound and one lane southbound;</li>

        <li>Transition A to B-one travel lane in each direction;</li>

        <li>Phase B-one travel lane northbound and two lanes southbound; and</li>

        <li>Transition B to A-one travel lane in each direction.</li>
      </ol></li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
      <p class="support">The typical application on the left illustrates the placement of devices during Phase A. The typical application on the right shows conditions during the transition (Transition A to B) from Phase A to Phase B.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span></p>

    <ol class="guidance" start="2">
      <li>For the reversible-lane situation depicted, the ends of the movable barrier should terminate in a protected area or a crash cushion should be provided. During Phase A, the transfer vehicle should be parked behind the downstream end of the movable barrier for southbound traffic as shown in the typical application on the left. During Phase B, the transfer vehicle should be parked behind between the downstream ends of the movable barriers at the north end of the TTC zone as shown in the typical application on the right.<br/> The transition shift from Phase A to B should be as follows: 

      <ol type="a">
        <li>Change the signs in the northbound advance warning area and transition area from a LEFT LANE CLOSED AHEAD to a 2 LEFT LANES CLOSED AHEAD. Change the mode of the second northbound arrow board from Caution to Right Arrow.</li>

        <li>Place channelizing devices to close the northbound center lane.</li>

        <li>Move the transfer vehicle from south to north to shift the movable barrier from the west side to the east side of the reversible lane.</li>

        <li>Remove the channelizing devices closing the southbound center lane.</li>

        <li>Change the signs in the southbound transition area and advance warning area from a 2 LEFT LANES CLOSED AHEAD to a LEFT LANE CLOSED AHEAD. Change the mode of the second southbound arrow board from Right Arrow to Caution.</li>
      </ol></li>

      <li>Where the lane to be opened and closed is an exterior lane (adjacent to the edge of the traveled way or the work space), the lane closure should begin by closing the lane with channelizing devices placed along a merging taper using the same information employed for a stationary lane closure. The lane closure should then be extended with the movable-barrier transfer vehicle moving with vehicular traffic. When opening the lane, the transfer vehicle should travel against vehicular traffic. The merging taper should be removed in a method similar to a stationary lane closure.</li>
