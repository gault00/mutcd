For additional discouragement to driving in the neutral area, bars or buttons projecting 1 to 3 inches above the pavement surface are sometimes placed in the neutral area. These bars or buttons are designed so that any wheel encroachment within the area will be obvious to the vehicle operator, but will result in only minimal effects on control of the vehicle. Such bars or buttons are sometimes preceded by rumble sections or their height is gradually increased as approached by traffic.</span> <span class="change_noted">Not needed</span></p></span>
