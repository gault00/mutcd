    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4T01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Lane-use control signals are special overhead signals that permit or prohibit the use of specific lanes of a street or highway or that indicate the impending prohibition of their use. Lane-use control signals are distinguished by placement of special signal faces over a certain lane or lanes of the roadway and by their distinctive shapes and symbols. Supplementary signs are sometimes used to explain their meaning and intent.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4T01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Lane-use control signals are most commonly used for reversible-lane control, but are also used in certain non-reversible lane applications and for toll plaza lanes (see Section 4<span class="text_deleted">K</span><span class="text_added">R</span>.02).</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4T01_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">An engineering study should be conducted to determine whether a reversible-lane operation can be controlled satisfactorily by static signs (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B36">Section 2B.<span class="text_deleted">26</span><span class="text_added">36</span></a>) or whether lane-use control signals are necessary. Lane-use control signals should be used to control reversible-lane operations if any of the following conditions are present:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="guidance">
      <li>More than one lane is reversed in direction;</li>

      <li>Two-way or one-way left turns are allowed during peak-period reversible operations, but those turns are from a different lane than used during off-peak periods;</li>

      <li>Other unusual or complex operations are included in the reversible-lane pattern;</li>

      <li>Demonstrated crash experience occurring with reversible-lane operation controlled by static signs that can be corrected by using lane-use control signals at the times of transition between peak and off-peak patterns; and/or</li>

      <li>An engineering study indicates that the safety and efficiency of the traffic operations of a reversible-lane system would be improved by lane-use control signals.</li>

      <li>On a freeway, near its terminus, to indicate a lane that ends;</li>

      <li>On a freeway or long bridge, to indicate that a lane may be temporarily blocked by a crash, breakdown, construction or maintenance activities, or similar temporary conditions; and</li>

      <li>On a conventional road or driveway, at access or egress points to or from a facility, such as a parking garage, where one or more lanes of the access or egress are opened or closed at various times.</li>
