    <h3 id="section2L01">Section 2L.01 Description of Changeable Message Signs</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para01">01</span><span class="support">A changeable message sign (CMS) is a traffic control device that is capable of displaying one or more alternative messages. Some changeable message signs have a blank mode when no message is displayed, while others display multiple messages with only one of the messages displayed at a time (such as OPEN/CLOSED signs at weigh stations).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para02">02</span><span class="support">The provisions in this Chapter apply to both permanent and portable changeable message signs with electronic displays<span class="text_added"> or the electronic display portion of an otherwise conventional static sign</span>. Additional provisions that only apply to portable changeable message signs can be found in <a href="part6l.xhtml#section6L05">Section <span class="text_deleted">6F.60</span><span class="text_added">6L.05</span></a>. The provisions in this Chapter <span class="text_added">generally </span>do not apply to changeable message signs with non-electronic displays that are changed either manually or electromechanically, such as a hinged-panel, rotating-drum, or back-lit curtain or scroll CMS.</span></p>

	<span class="text_added">
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para03">03</span><span class="support">The CMS is a traffic control device at all times regardless of the type of message being displayed. Accordingly, the limitations on design, format and manner of displayed of a message conveyed on a traffic control device apply to changeable message signs regardless of the type of message being displayed at any given time. Some of the general provisions regarding traffic control devices are reiterated in this Chapter. However, this Chapter is not an independent or stand-alone reference for changeable message signs. Users of Chapter 2L are expected to consult the other chapters in this Manual for criteria on how to develop effective messages that comply with this Manual and meet the expectancy and limitations of the road user. In this regard, the engineering processes applied to decisions about whether to use a particular sign, for example, are no different for the decisions about the type and content of the message under consideration for display on a changeable message sign. The other limited use messages allowed on CMS as provided for in this chapter likewise fall under the same MUTCD provisions as the primary use traffic operation regulatory, warning and guidance messages except as stated otherwise in this chapter.</span></p>

Because such a sign is effectively an illuminated version of a static sign, the size of its legend elements, the overall size of the sign, and placement of the sign should comply with the applicable provisions for the static version of the sign.</span></p>

Legibility distance is affected by the characteristics of the sign design and the visual capabilities of drivers. Visual capabilities, and thus legibility distances, vary among drivers.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2L03_para02">02</span><span class="support">For the more common types of changeable message signs, the longest measured legibility distances on sunny days occur during mid-day when the sun is overhead. Legibility distances are much shorter when the sun is behind the sign face, when the sun is on the horizon and shining on the sign face, or at night.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2L03_para03">03</span><span class="support">Visibility is the characteristic that enables a CMS to be seen. Visibility is associated with the point where the CMS is first detected, whereas legibility is the point where the message on the CMS can be read. Environmental conditions such as rain, fog, and snow impact the visibility of changeable message signs and can reduce the available legibility distances. During these conditions, there might not be enough viewing time for drivers to read the message.</span></p>

The message should be designed to be legible from a minimum distance of 600 feet for nighttime conditions and 800 feet for normal daylight conditions. When environmental conditions that reduce visibility and legibility are present, or when the legibility distances stated in the previous sentences in this paragraph cannot be practically achieved, messages composed of fewer units of information should be used and consideration should be given to limiting the message to a single phase (see <a href="#section2L05">Section 2L.05</a> for information regarding the lengths of messages displayed on changeable message signs).</span></p>
