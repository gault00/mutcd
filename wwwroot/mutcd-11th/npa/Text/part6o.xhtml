    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para01">01</span><span class="support">The National Incident Management System (NIMS) requires the use of the Incident Command System (ICS) at traffic incident management scenes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para02">02</span><span class="support">A traffic incident is an emergency road user occurrence, a natural disaster, or other unplanned event that affects or impedes the normal flow of traffic.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para03">03</span><span class="support">A traffic incident management area is an area of a highway where temporary traffic controls are installed, as authorized by a public authority or the official having jurisdiction of the roadway, in response to a road user incident, natural disaster, hazardous material spill, or other unplanned incident. It is a type of TTC zone and extends from the first warning device (such as a sign, light, or cone) to the last TTC device or to a point where vehicles return to the original lane alignment and are clear of the incident.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para04">04</span><span class="support">Traffic incidents can be divided into three general classes of duration, each of which has unique traffic control characteristics and needs. These classes are:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="support">
      <li>Major—expected duration of more than 2 hours,</li>

      <li>Intermediate—expected duration of 30 minutes to 2 hours, and</li>

      <li>Minor—expected duration under 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para05">05</span><span class="support">The primary functions of TTC at a traffic incident management area are to inform road users of the incident and to provide guidance information on the path to follow through the incident area. Alerting road users and establishing a well<span class="text_deleted"> </span><span class="text_added">-</span>defined path to guide road users through the incident area will serve to protect the incident responders and those involved in working at the incident scene and will aid in moving road users expeditiously past or around the traffic incident, will reduce the likelihood of secondary traffic crashes, and will preclude unnecessary use of the surrounding local road system. Examples include a stalled vehicle blocking a lane, a traffic crash blocking the traveled way, a hazardous material spill along a highway, and natural disasters such as floods and severe storm damage.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">In order to reduce response time for traffic incidents, highway agencies, appropriate public safety agencies (law enforcement, fire and rescue, emergency communications, emergency medical, and other emergency management), and private sector responders (towing and recovery and hazardous materials contractors) should mutually plan for occurrences of traffic incidents along the major and heavily traveled highway and street system.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O01_para07">07</span><span class="guidance">On-scene responder organizations should train their personnel in TTC practices for accomplishing their tasks in and near traffic and in the requirements for traffic incident management contained in this Manual. On-scene responders should take measures to move the incident off the traveled roadway or to provide for appropriate warning. All on-scene responders and news media personnel should constantly be aware of their visibility to oncoming traffic and wear high-visibility apparel.<span class="text_added"> Planning and training should include incorporation of estimated time durations to clear the event as part of their initial incident estimate. When events are deemed as probable Major Traffic Incidents that may or will generate prolonged lane or road closures, notification of all affected agencies should be initiated and may be included as part of the initial incident report that is provided to the emergency communications center who would then be responsible for making notifications to appropriate state, regional and local agencies and resources for the purpose of ramping up and responding as quickly as possible thus facilitating a more rapid transition from emergency TTC to MUTCD compliant work zone when warranted.</span></span><span class="change_noted">Added to improve accuracy</span></p>

The ability to quickly install proper temporary traffic controls might greatly reduce the effects of an incident, such as secondary crashes or excessive traffic delays. An essential part of fire, rescue, spill clean-up, highway agency, and enforcement activities is the proper control of road users through the traffic incident management area in order to protect responders, victims, and other personnel at the site. These operations might need corroborating legislative authority for the implementation and enforcement of appropriate road user regulations, parking controls, and speed zoning. It is desirable for these statutes to provide sufficient flexibility in the authority for, and implementation of, TTC to respond to the needs of changing conditions found in traffic incident management areas.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O02_para01">01</span><span class="support">Major traffic incidents are typically traffic incidents involving hazardous materials, fatal traffic crashes involving numerous vehicles, and other natural or man-made disasters. These traffic incidents typically involve closing all or part of a roadway facility for a period exceeding 2 hours.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O02_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">If the traffic incident is anticipated to last more than 24 hours, applicable procedures and devices set forth in other Chapters of <a href="part6_toc.html">Part 6</a> should be used.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O02_para03">03</span><span class="support">A road closure can be caused by a traffic incident such as a road user crash that blocks the traveled way. Road users are usually diverted through lane shifts or detoured around the traffic incident and back to the original roadway. A combination of traffic engineering and enforcement preparations is needed to determine the detour route, and to install, maintain or operate, and then to remove the necessary traffic control devices when the detour is terminated. Large trucks are a significant concern in such a detour, especially when detouring them from a controlled-access roadway onto local or arterial streets.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O02_para04">04</span><span class="support">During traffic incidents, large trucks might need to follow a route separate from that of automobiles because of bridge, weight, clearance, or geometric restrictions. Also, vehicles carrying hazardous material might need to follow a different route from other vehicles.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O02_para05">05</span><span class="support">Some traffic incidents such as hazardous material spills might require closure of an entire highway. Through road users must have adequate guidance around the traffic incident. Maintaining good public relations is desirable. The cooperation of the news media in publicizing the existence of, and reasons for, traffic incident management areas and their TTC can be of great assistance in keeping road users and the general public well informed.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section6O05">Section <span class="text_deleted">6I.05</span><span class="text_added">6O.05</span> Use of Emergency-Vehicle Lighting</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O05_para01">01</span><span class="support">The use of emergency-vehicle lighting (such as high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights) is essential, especially in the initial stages of a traffic incident, for the safety of emergency responders and persons involved in the traffic incident, as well as road users approaching the traffic incident. Emergency-vehicle lighting, however, provides warning only and provides no effective traffic control. The use of too many lights at an incident scene can be distracting and can create confusion for approaching road users, especially at night. Road users approaching the traffic incident from the opposite direction on a divided facility are often distracted by emergency-vehicle lighting and slow their vehicles to look at the traffic incident posing a hazard to themselves and others traveling in their direction.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O05_para02">02</span><span class="support">The use of emergency-vehicle lighting can be reduced if good traffic control has been established at a traffic incident scene. This is especially true for major traffic incidents that might involve a number of emergency vehicles. If good traffic control is established through placement of advanced warning signs and traffic control devices to divert or detour traffic, then public safety agencies can perform their tasks on scene with minimal emergency-vehicle lighting.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6O05_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Public safety agencies should examine their policies on the use of emergency-vehicle lighting, especially after a traffic incident scene is secured, with the intent of reducing the use of this lighting as much as possible while not endangering those at the scene. Special consideration should be given to reducing or extinguishing forward facing emergency-vehicle lighting, especially on divided roadways, to reduce distractions to oncoming road users.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6O05_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">Because the glare from floodlights or vehicle headlights can impair the nighttime vision of approaching road users, any floodlights or vehicle headlights that are not needed for illumination, or to provide notice to other road users of an incident response vehicle being in an unexpected location, should be turned off at night.</span></p>
