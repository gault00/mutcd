    <span class="text_deleted"><h3>Section 7C.01 Functions and Limitations</h3><span class="change_noted">Not needed, redundant with Section 3A.01</span>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="support">Markings have definite and important functions in a proper scheme of school area traffic control. In some cases, they are used to supplement the regulations or warnings provided by other devices, such as traffic signs or signals. In other instances, they are used alone and produce results that cannot be obtained by the use of any other device. In such cases they serve as an effective means of conveying certain regulations, guidance, and warnings that could not otherwise be made clearly understandable.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support">Pavement markings have some potential limitations. They might be obscured by snow, might not be clearly visible when wet, and might not be durable when subjected to heavy traffic. In spite of these potential limitations, they have the advantage, under favorable conditions, of conveying warnings or information to the road user without diverting attention from the road.</span></p></span>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7C01_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">Crosswalks should be marked at all intersections on established routes to a school where there is substantial conflict between motorists, bicyclists, and student movements; where students are encouraged to cross between intersections; where students would not otherwise recognize the proper place to cross; or where motorists or bicyclists might not expect students to cross (see <a href="part7a.xhtml#figure7A01">Figure 7A-1</a>).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7C01_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">Crosswalk lines should not be used indiscriminately. An engineering study considering the factors described in <a href="part3c.xhtml#section3C02">Section <span class="text_deleted">3B.18</span><span class="text_added">3C.02</span></a> should be performed before a marked crosswalk is installed at a location away from a traffic control signal or an approach controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7C01_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Because non-intersection school crossings are generally unexpected by the road user, warning signs (see <a href="part7b.xhtml#section7B03">Sections 7B.<span class="text_deleted">11</span><span class="text_added">03</span></a><span class="text_deleted"> and <a href="part7b.xhtml#section7B12">7B.12</a></span>) should be installed for all marked school crosswalks at non-intersection locations. Adequate visibility of students by approaching motorists and of approaching motorists by students should be provided by parking prohibitions or other appropriate measures.</span></p>
