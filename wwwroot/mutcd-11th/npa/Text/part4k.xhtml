    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4K01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Accessible pedestrian signals and detectors provide information in non-visual formats (such as audible tones, speech messages, and/or vibrating surfaces).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4K01_para02">02</span><span class="support">The primary technique that pedestrians who have visual disabilities use to cross streets at signalized locations is to initiate their crossing when they hear the traffic in front of them stop and the traffic alongside them begin to move, which often corresponds to the onset of the green interval. The existing environment is often not sufficient to provide the information that pedestrians who have visual disabilities need to cross a roadway at a signalized location.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4K01_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">If a particular signalized location presents difficulties for pedestrians who have <span class="text_deleted">visual</span><span class="text_added">vision</span> disabilities to cross the roadway, an engineering study should be conducted that considers the needs of pedestrians in general, as well as the information needs of pedestrians with <span class="text_deleted">visual</span><span class="text_added">vision</span> disabilities. The engineering study should consider the following factors:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="guidance">
      <li>Potential demand for accessible pedestrian signals;</li>

      <li>A request for accessible pedestrian signals;</li>

      <li>Traffic volumes during times when pedestrians might be present, including periods of low traffic volumes or high turn-on-red volumes;</li>

      <li>The complexity of traffic signal phasing (such as split phases, protected turn phases, leading pedestrian intervals, and exclusive pedestrian phases); and</li>

      <li>The complexity of intersection geometry.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4K01_para04">04</span><span class="support">The factors that make crossing at a signalized location difficult for pedestrians who have visual disabilities include: increasingly quiet cars, right turn on red (which masks the beginning of the through phase), continuous right-turn movements, complex signal operations, traffic circles, and wide streets. Furthermore, low traffic volumes might make it difficult for pedestrians who have visual disabilities to discern signal phase changes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4K01_para05">05</span><span class="support">Local organizations, providing support services to pedestrians who have visual and/or hearing disabilities, can often act as important advisors to the traffic engineer when consideration is being given to the installation of devices to assist such pedestrians. Additionally, orientation and mobility specialists or similar staff also might be able to provide a wide range of advice. The U.S. Access Board (www.access-board.gov) provides technical assistance for making pedestrian signal information available to persons with visual disabilities (see Page i for the address for the U.S. Access Board).</span></p>
