This separation should begin on the approach to the mainline toll plaza at approximately the point where the vehicle speeds in the adjacent cash lanes drop below 30 mph during off-peak periods and should extend downstream beyond the toll plaza approximately to the point where the vehicles departing the toll plaza in the adjacent cash lanes have accelerated to 30 mph.</span></p>
