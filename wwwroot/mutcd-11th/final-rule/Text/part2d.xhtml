    <h3 id="section2D01">Section 2D.01 Scope of Conventional Road Guide Sign Standards and Application</h3>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para01">01</span><span class="standard">The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to any road or street other than  expressways, and freeways, except as otherwise provided in this Manual.</span></p>

	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Guide signs direct road users along streets and highways; inform them of intersecting routes; direct them to cities, towns, villages, or other important destinations; identify nearby rivers and streams, parks, forests, and historical sites; and provide information that will help them along their way in the most simple and direct manner possible.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">The selection of primary or control destinations (those displayed consistently over longer distances along a route) displayed on guide signs should be meaningful to road users in navigation and orientation. The destinations selected should be identifiable on official maps.</span></p>
	

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">The familiarity of the road users with the road should be considered in determining the need for guide signs on low-volume roads.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para05">05</span><span class="support">Low-volume roads generally do not require guide signs to the extent that they are needed on higher classes of roads. Because guide signs are typically only beneficial as a navigational aid for road users who are unfamiliar with a low-volume road, guide signs might not be needed on low-volume roads that serve only local traffic.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para06">06</span><span class="support">Guide signs, other than Street Name signs, generally are not used on low-volume rural roads except as needed to guide road users back to the major roadways.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para07">07</span><span class="guidance">If used on low-volume roads, destination names should be as specific and descriptive as possible. Destinations such as campgrounds, ranger stations, recreational areas, and the like should be clearly indicated so that they are not interpreted to be communities or locations with road user services.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para08">08</span><span class="option">Guide signs may be used on low-volume roads at intersections to provide information for road users returning to a higher class of roads.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2D01_para09">09</span><span class="support"><a href="part2a.xhtml">Chapter 2A</a> addresses placement, location, and other general criteria for signs.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D02_para01">01</span><span class="support">Requirements for illumination, retroreflection, and color are stated under the specific headings for individual guide signs or groups of signs. General provisions are given in <a href="part2a.xhtml#section2A06">Sections 2A.06</a>, <a href="part2a.xhtml#section2A07">2A.07</a>, and <a href="part2a.xhtml#section2A22">2A.22</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D02_para02">02</span><span class="standard">Except as otherwise provided in this Manual for individual signs or groups of signs, guide signs on streets and highways shall have a white message and border on a green background. All messages, borders, and legends shall be retroreflective and all backgrounds shall be retroreflective or illuminated.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D02_para03">03</span><span class="support">Color coding is sometimes used to help road users distinguish between multiple potentially confusing destinations. Examples of valuable uses of color coding include guide signs for roadways approaching or inside an airport property with multiple terminals serving multiple airlines, and community wayfinding guide signs for various traffic generator destinations within a community or area.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D02_para04">04</span><span class="standard">Except as otherwise provided in this Manual, different color sign backgrounds shall not be used to provide color coding of destinations. The color coding shall be accomplished by the use of different colored square or rectangular sign panels on the face of the guide signs (see ).</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D02_para05">05</span><span class="option">The different colored sign panels on the face of a sign may include a black or white (whichever provides the better contrast with the panel color) letter, numeral, or other appropriate designation to identify an airport terminal or other destination.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D02_para06">06</span><span class="support"><a href="#section2D55">Section 2D.55</a> contains specific provisions regarding Community Wayfinding guide signs.</span></p>

These signs are intended to be permanently installed to provide instant rerouting guidance to road users when traffic congestion or backups first begin even before emergency responders could provide temporary traffic control for rerouting traffic. These signs can be used as a stand-alone system or be part of a larger system which might also incorporate other devices such as changeable message signs. These signs provide road users assurance that a diversionary route will lead them back to their original route of travel.</span></p>

	<h2>Signing at Airports</h2>

	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D60_para01">01</span><span class="support">Many roadways within airport facilities (including terminal curbside roadways) are considered to be conventional roads because they typically have frequent driveways and at-grade intersections and might have pedestrian activity along and/or across them.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2D60_para02">02</span><span class="support">Some airport roadways have full or partial control of access and operating speeds higher than 45 mph and thus would be classified as freeways or expressways for signing purposes (see <a href="part2e.xhtml">Chapter 2E</a>). Freeway or expressway conditions typically exist on the approaches to the airport from other highways; on the approaches to access points to terminals, parking, and other patron facilities; and on roadways that provide exits from the airport facility to connect with the local or regional highway network.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2D60_para03">03</span><span class="support">Roadways within airports and other similarly-contained roadway networks with multiple closely-spaced access points to multiple destinations (such as terminals, parking facilities, rental car facilities, and other airport services) often present challenges for the application of guide signing. Closely-spaced signs, excessive sign messaging either co-located or in succession, and the resulting excessive informational load imposed on the road user are of particular concern for such roadways. The Transportation Research Board’s Airport Cooperative Research Program Report 52, “Wayfinding and Signing Guidelines for Airport Terminal and Landside,” contains additional information on the application of traffic control devices to the unique geometrics and roadway environment that are typical of airports.</span></p>

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2D60_para05">05</span><span class="guidance">If adequate sign spacing cannot be provided due to the site and roadway characteristics of an airport or similar facility, then measures should be taken to reduce the speeds of vehicles on the roadway to provide road users with adequate time to comprehend and respond to the sign messages. Consideration should also be given to increasing the sign letter heights to provide greater viewing distances and decision times. Where a single terminal serves a large number of airlines, the airline information should be displayed on separate signs that appear in sequence to limit the number of airlines displayed on a single sign or at a single location. Changeable message signs (see <a href="part2l.xhtml">Chapter 2L</a>) should not be used to rotate the display airlines to an approaching road user.</span></p>
