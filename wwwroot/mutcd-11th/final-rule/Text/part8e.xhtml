    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section8E01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Traffic control for pathway and sidewalk grade crossings includes all signs, signals, markings, other warning devices, and their supports at pathway and sidewalk grade crossings and along pathway and sidewalk approaches to grade crossings. The function of this traffic control is to promote safety and provide effective operation of both rail and pathway or sidewalk traffic at pathway or sidewalk grade crossings.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section8E01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Other physical treatments that are described in this Chapter that are also applicable to pathways and sidewalks at grade crossings, such as detectable warnings, swing gates, and fencing, provide increased safety for pathway and sidewalk users.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section8E01_para03">03</span><span class="support">Crosswalk markings at intersections where pedestrians cross LRT tracks in mixed-use alignments are covered by the provisions of <a href="part3c.xhtml">Chapter 3C</a> rather than by the provisions of this Chapter.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E01_para04">04</span><span class="support"><a href="#figure8E01">Figure 8E-1</a> illustrates the difference between a pathway grade crossing and a sidewalk grade crossing. A pathway is frequently placed in its own right-of-way on an alignment that is independent of any roadway. If a pathway is built parallel to a roadway, it is physically separated from the roadway by an open space or barrier such that the traffic control devices for the roadway grade crossing do not exert an influence over or provide adequate warning to pathway users. A sidewalk runs parallel to a roadway within the highway right-of-way and is close enough to the edge of the roadway's traveled way that the traffic control devices for the roadway grade crossing can frequently exert an influence over or provide adequate warning to sidewalk users. Pathways are typically used by both pedestrians and bicyclists, whereas sidewalks are typically used only by pedestrians.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">The traffic control devices, including the appropriate traffic control system to be used, and other physical treatments at a pathway or sidewalk grade crossing should be determined by a Diagnostic Team that include the agency with jurisdiction over the pathway or sidewalk.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">At skewed grade crossings, the adjustment, re-alignment, or relocation of existing sidewalk grade crossings should be considered when determining the placement of traffic control devices for roadway users.</span></p>

	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para04">04</span><span class="support">The safety of pathway and sidewalk users is enhanced when pathways and sidewalks are designed such that they do not cross the tracks at a narrow angle. The casters of wheelchairs and the wheels of bicycles could fall into and might be constrained in the flangeway gap at a skewed crossing. The flangeway gap is typically 2.5 inches wide at LRT grade crossings and 3 inches wide at railroad grade crossings.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para05">05</span><span class="support">It is desirable that pathways and sidewalks be designed such that they maintain a relatively consistent horizontal alignment and profile from the nearest rail to the detectable warning (if present) or from the nearest rail to the stop line (if present) on each approach to the crossing. Providing a pedestrian refuge area in advance of the stop line or the detectable warning surface so that pedestrians have a place to wait while rail traffic approaches and occupies the crossing can be beneficial to pedestrian safety.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section8E02_para06">06</span><span class="support">When designing new sidewalk grade crossings, placing the sidewalk outside of the area occupied by grade crossing traffic control devices for vehicular traffic is desirable (see <a href="#figure8E02">Figure 8E-2</a>). This includes making sure that the counterweights and support arms for the automatic gates for vehicular traffic do not obstruct the sidewalk when the gate is fully lowered.</span></p>
