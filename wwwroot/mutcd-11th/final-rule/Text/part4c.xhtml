    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para02">02</span><span class="standard">The investigation of the need for a traffic control signal shall include an analysis of factors related to the existing operation and safety at the study location and the potential to improve these conditions, and the applicable factors contained in the following traffic signal warrants:</span></p>

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para05">05</span><span class="guidance">When considering the installation of a traffic control signal, alternatives to traffic control signals, including those listed in <a href="part4b.xhtml#section4B03">Section 4B.03</a>, should also be considered.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">A traffic control signal should not be installed unless one or more of the factors described in this Chapter are met.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para07">07</span><span class="guidance">A traffic control signal should not be installed unless an engineering study indicates that installing a traffic control signal will improve the overall safety and/or operation of the intersection.</span></p>

    

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para08">08</span><span class="guidance">The study should consider the effects of the right-turning vehicles from the minor-street approaches. Engineering judgment should be used to determine what, if any, portion of the right-turning traffic is subtracted from the minor-street traffic count when evaluating the count against the signal warrants listed in <a href="#section4C01_para02">Paragraph 2</a> of this Section.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para09">09</span><span class="guidance">Engineering judgment should also be used in applying various traffic signal warrants to cases where major-street approaches consist of one lane plus one left-turn or right-turn lane. The site-specific traffic characteristics should dictate whether a major-street approach is considered as one lane or two lanes. For example, for a major-street approach with one lane for through and right-turning traffic plus a left-turn lane, if engineering judgment indicates that it should be considered a one-lane approach because the traffic using the left-turn lane is minor, the total traffic volume approaching the intersection should be applied against the signal warrants as a one-lane approach. The major-srreet approach should be considered two lanes if approximately half of the traffic on the approach turns left and the left-turn lane is of sufficient length to accommodate all left-turning vehicles.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para10">10</span><span class="guidance">Similar engineering judgment and rationale should be applied to a minor-street approach with one through/left-turn lane plus a right-turn lane. In this case, the degree of conflict of minor-street right-turning traffic with traffic on the major street should be considered. Thus, right-turn traffic should not be included in the minor-street volume if the movement enters the major street with minimal conflict. The minor-street approach should be evaluated as a one-lane approach with only the traffic volume in the through/left-turn lane considered.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para11">11</span><span class="guidance">If a minor-street approach has one combined through/right-turn lane plus a left-turn lane, the approach should either be analyzed as a two-lane approach based on the sum of the traffic volumes using both lanes or as a one-lane approach based on only the traffic volume in the approach lane with the higher volume.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4C01_para12">12</span><span class="guidance">At a location that is under development or construction  or at a location where it is not possible to obtain a traffic count that would represent future traffic conditions, hourly volumes should be estimated as part of an engineering study for comparison with traffic signal warrants. Except for locations where the engineering study uses the satisfaction of Warrant 8 to justify a signal, a traffic control signal installed under projected conditions should have an engineering study done within 1 year of putting the signal into steady (stop-and-go) operation to determine if the signal is justified. If not justified, the signal should be taken out of steady (stop-and-go) operation or removed.</span></p>

Installation of a traffic control signal does not necessarily result in improved safety in every case. In some cases, the installation of a traffic control signal at an inappropriate location could adversely impact safety for one or more types of road users. The purpose of the engineering study is to evaluat eall the factors that are reelvant to a specific location. The satisfication of a warrant (or warrants) is one of the relevant factors in the engineering study, but it is not intended to be the only factor or even the overriding consideration. Agencies can install a traffic control signal at a location where no warrants are met, but only after conducting an engineering study that documents that rationale for deciding that the installation of a traffic control signal is the best solution for improving the overall safety and/or operation at the location.</span></p>
