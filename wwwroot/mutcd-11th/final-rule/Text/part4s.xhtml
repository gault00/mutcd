    <h1>Chapter 4S. Flashing Beacons</h1>

    <h3 id="section4S01">Section 4S.01 General Design and Operation of Flashing Beacons</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para01">01</span><span class="support">A flashing beacon is a highway traffic signal with one or more signal sections that operates in a flashing mode. It can provide traffic control when used as an intersection control beacon (see <a href="#section4S02">Section 4S.02</a>) or it can provide warning when used in other applications (see <a href="#section4S03">Sections 4S.03</a>, <a href="#section4S04">4S.04</a>, and <a href="#section4S05">4S.05</a>).</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para02">02</span><span class="standard">Flashing beacon units, their mountings, signal visors, and backplates shall comply with the provisions of <a href="part4d.xhtml">Chapters 4D</a> and <a href="part4e.xhtml">4E</a>, except as otherwise provided in this Chapter.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para03">03</span><span class="standard">Beacons shall be flashed at a rate of not less than 50 or more than 60 times per minute. The illuminated period of each flash shall be a minimum of 1/2 and a maximum of 2/3 of the total cycle.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para04">04</span><span class="standard">A beacon shall not be included within the border of a sign except for Interchange Exit Direction signs with advisory speed panels (see <a href="#section2E25">Sections 2E.25</a>).</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para05">05</span><span class="standard">There shall be two nominal diameter sizes for flashing beacon signal indications: 8 inches and 12 inches.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">If used to supplement a warning or regulatory sign, the edge of the beacon signal housing should normally be located no closer than 12 inches outside of the nearest edge of the sign or from the nearest edge of any of the signs and plaques in a sign assembly.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para07">07</span><span class="option">An automatic dimming device may be used to reduce the brilliance of flashing yellow signal indications during night operation.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section4S01_para08">08</span><span class="option">Backplates (see <a href="part4d.xhtml#section4D06">Section 4D.06</a>) may be used with flashing beacons.</span></p>
	

    <h3 id="section4S02">Section 4S.02 Intersection Control Beacon</h3>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para01">01</span><span class="standard">An Intersection Control Beacon shall consist of one or more signal faces directed toward each approach to an intersection. Each signal face shall consist of one or more signal sections of a standard traffic signal face, with flashing CIRCULAR YELLOW or CIRCULAR RED signal indications in each signal face. They shall be installed and used only at an intersection to control two or more directions of travel.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para02">02</span><span class="standard">Application of Intersection Control Beacon signal indications shall be limited to the following:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="standard">
      <li>Yellow on one route (normally the major street) and red for the remaining approaches that are controlled by STOP signs, or</li>

      <li>Red for all approaches (if all of the intersection approaches are controlled by STOP signs).</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para03">03</span><span class="standard">Flashing yellow signal indications shall not face conflicting vehicular approaches.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para04">04</span><span class="standard">A STOP sign (see <a href="#section2B04">Sections 2B.04</a>) shall be used on approaches to which a flashing red signal indication is displayed on an Intersection Control Beacon.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para05">05</span><span class="standard">If two horizontally aligned red signal indications are used on an approach for an Intersection Control Beacon, they shall be flashed simultaneously to avoid being confused with grade crossing flashing-light signals. If two vertically aligned red signal indications that have a physical separation between them are used on an approach for an Intersection Control Beacon, they shall be flashed alternately.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para06">06</span><span class="standard">Twelve-inch signal indications shall be used for Intersection Control Beacons facing approaches where:</span></p>
	<ol type="A" class="standard">
		<li>Road users view both Intersection Control Beacon and lane-use control signal indications simultaneously; or</li>
		<li>The nearest Intersection Control Beacon signal face is more than 120 feet beyond the stop line, unless a supplemental near-side Intersection Control Beacon signal face face is provided.</li>
	</ol>
	

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para07">07</span><span class="guidance">Twelve-inch signal indications should be used for Intersection Control Beacons facing approaches where:</span></p>

	
	<ol type="A" class="guidance">
		<li>The posted or statutory speed limit or the 85th-percentile approach speed is higher than 40 mph, or</li>
		<li>Where only post-mounted flashing beacon signal faces are used.</li>
	</ol>
	

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para08">08</span><span class="guidance">An Intersection Control Beacon should not be mounted on a pedestal in the roadway unless the pedestal is within the confines of a traffic or pedestrian island.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para09">09</span><span class="option">Supplemental signal indications may be used on one or more approaches in order to provide adequate visibility to approaching road users.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para10">10</span><span class="option">Intersection Control Beacons may be used at intersections where traffic or physical conditions do not justify conventional traffic control signals but crash rates indicate the possibility of a special need.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4S02_para11">11</span><span class="option">An Intersection Control Beacon is generally located over the center of an intersection; however, it may be used at other suitable locations.</span></p>

      <li>As supplemental emphasis to warning signs;</li>

      <li>As emphasis for midblock crosswalks;</li>

      <li>As supplemental emphasis to regulatory signs, except STOP, DO NOT ENTER, WRONG WAY, and SPEED LIMIT signs; and</li>

      <li>In conjunction with a regulatory or warning sign that includes the phrase WHEN FLASHING in its legend or on a supplemental plaque to indicate that the regulation is in effect or that the condition is present only at certain times. <a href="part2a.xhtml#section2A12">Section 2A.12</a> prohibits the use flashing light-emitting diode (LED) units within the legend or border of the sign in conjunction with the phrase WHEN FLASHING in its legend or on a supplemental plaque.</li>
