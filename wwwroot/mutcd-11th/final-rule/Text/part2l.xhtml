    <h1>Chapter 2L. Changeable Message Signs</h1>

    <h3 id="section2L01">Section 2L.01 Description of Changeable Message Signs</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para01">01</span><span class="support">A changeable message sign (CMS) is a traffic control device that is capable of displaying one or more alternative messages. Some CMS have a blank mode when no message is displayed, while others display multiple messages with only one of the messages displayed at a time (such as OPEN/CLOSED signs at weigh stations).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para02">02</span><span class="support">The provisions in this Chapter apply to both permanent and portable changeable message signs with electronic displays or the electronic display portion of an otherwise conventional static sign. Additional provisions that only apply to portable changeable message signs can be found in <a href="part6l.xhtml#section6L05">Section 6L.05</a>. The provisions in this Chapter generally do not apply to changeable message signs with non-electronic displays that are changed either manually or electromechanically, such as a hinged-panel, rotating-drum, or back-lit curtain or scroll CMS.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para03">03</span><span class="support">The CMS is a traffic control device at all times regardless of the type of message being displayed. Accordingly, the limitations on design, format, and manner of display of a message conveyed on a conventional sign apply to CMS regardless of the type of message being displayed at any given time. Some of the general provisions regarding traffic control devices are reiterated in this Chapter. However, this Chapter is not an independent or stand-alone reference for CMS. Users of CMS are expected to consult the other chapters in this Manual for criteria on how to develop effective messages that comply with this Manual and meet the expectancy and limitations of the road user. In this regard, the engineering processes applied to decisions about whether to use a particular sign, for example, are no different for the decisions about the type and content of the message under consideration for display on a CMS. The other limited-use messages allowed on CMS as provided for in this Chapter likewise fall under the same MUTCD provisions as the primary-use traffic operation regulatory, warning, and guidance messages except as stated otherwise in this chapter.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para04">04</span><span class="support">CMS messaging can be subject to habituation, a phenomenon by which repeated exposure to a stimulus results in diminished response. CMS habituation can occur through repeated exposure to messages, especially those messages that might not be perceived as having relevance to the road user, resulting in diminished responsiveness of the road user to that message. Because messages can be changed or extinguished, the effectiveness of CMS is tied more to the messages displayed thereon, the frequency of displayed messages, and the relevance to the road user, rather than to the installation of the signs themselves.</span></p>

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para05">05</span><span class="guidance">Changeable message signs should be used judiciously to avoid habituation and preserve their effectiveness during the display of real-time messages about traffic conditions or traffic advisories.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para06">06</span><span class="standard">The design of legends for non-electronic display CMS shall comply with the provisions of Chapters 2A through 2K, 2M, and 2N of this Manual. Other CMS shall comply with the design and application principles established in this Chapter, Chapter 2A, and provisions elsewhere in this Manual for specific signs.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para07">07</span><span class="standard">No items other than inventory or maintenance-related information (see <a href="part2a.xhtml#section2A04">Section 2A.04</a> of this Manual) shall be displayed on the front or back of a CMS or portable CMS. Names or logos of the manufacturer, brand, or model shall not be displayed on a CMS or portable CMS, either in the message display itself or on the exterior housing.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L01_para08">08</span><span class="guidance">Blank-out signs that display only single-phase, predetermined electronic-display legends that are limited by their composition and arrangement of pixels or other illuminated forms in a fixed arrangement (such as a blank-out sign indicating a part-time turn prohibition, a blank-out or changeable lane-use sign, or a changeable OPEN/CLOSED sign for a weigh station) should comply with the provisions of the applicable Section for the specific type of sign, provided that the letter forms, symbols, and other legend elements are duplicates of the static messages as detailed in the “Standard Highway Signs” publication (see <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A05">Section 1A.05</a>). Because such a sign is effectively an illuminated version of a conventional sign, the size of its legend elements, the overall size of the sign, and the placement of the sign should comply with the applicable provisions for the conventional version of the sign.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2L02_para09">09</span><span class="support">CMS provide significant flexibility and capability in communicating many types of real-time traffic control messages to road users. While their intended purpose is the display of traffic regulatory, warning, or guidance information, other limited uses are also allowed in certain conditions, as provided in this Chapter. Their integrity as an official traffic control device rests significantly on their judicious use and proper messaging format and content, regardless of the message type being displayed.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section2L03">Section 2L.03 Legibility and Visibility of Changeable Message Signs</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L03_para01">01</span><span class="support">The maximum distance at which a driver can first correctly identify letters and words on a sign is called the legibility distance of the sign. Legibility distance is affected by the characteristics of the sign design and the visual capabilities of drivers. Visual capabilities, and thus legibility distances, vary among drivers.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2L03_para02">02</span><span class="support">For the more common types of CMS, the longest measured legibility distances on sunny days occur during mid-day when the sun is overhead. Legibility distances are much shorter when the sun is behind the sign face, when the sun is on the horizon and shining on the sign face, or at night.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2L03_para03">03</span><span class="support">Visibility is the characteristic that enables a CMS to be seen. Visibility is associated with the point where the CMS is first detected, whereas legibility is the point where the message on the CMS can be read. Environmental conditions such as rain, fog, and snow impact the visibility of CMS and can reduce the available legibility distances. During these conditions, there might not be enough viewing time for drivers to read the message.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2L03_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">CMS used on roadways with speed limits of 55 mph or higher should be visible from 1/2 mile under both day and night conditions. The message should be designed to be legible from a minimum distance of 600 feet for nighttime conditions and 800 feet for normal daylight conditions. When environmental conditions that reduce visibility and legibility are present, or when the legibility distances stated in the previous sentences in this paragraph cannot be practically achieved, messages composed of fewer units of information should be used and consideration should be given to limiting the message to a single phase (see <a href="#section2L05">Section 2L.05</a> for information regarding the lengths of messages displayed on CMS).</span></p>
