A shared signal face always displays the same color of circular indication that is displayed by the signal face or faces for the adjacent movement. If a shared signal face that provides protected/permissive mode left turns is mounted overhead for an approach that includes a mandatory left-turn lane, it is usually positioned over or slightly to the right of the extension of the lane line separating the left-turn lane from the adjacent lane. If a shared signal face that provides protected/permissive mode left turns is mounted overhead for an approach that does not include an exclusive left-turn lane, it is usually positioned over the center of the combined left-turn/straight-through lane.</li>

      <li>Separate left-turn signal face – This type of signal face controls only the left-turn movement and cannot serve as one of the two required primary signal faces for the adjacent movement (usually the through movement) because it displays signal indications that are applicable only to the left-turn movement. This type of signal face is used only for an approach that has a mandatory left-turn lane(s). If a separate left-turn signal face is mounted overhead at the intersection, it is positioned over the extension of the mandatory left-turn lane. In a separate left-turn signal face, a flashing left-turn YELLOW ARROW signal indication or a flashing left-turn RED ARROW signal indication is used to control permissive left-turning movements.</li>
