    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4G03_para09">09</span><span class="standard">The appropriate RED ARROW or YELLOW ARROW signal indication shall be flashed when a signal face consists entirely of arrow indications. A signal face that consists entirely of arrow indications and that provides a protected only turn movement during the steady (stop-and-go) mode or that provides a flashing yellow arrow or flashing red arrow signal indication for a permissive turn movement during the steady (stop-and-go) mode shall be permitted to flash the YELLOW ARROW signal indication during the flashing mode if the adjacent through movement signal indications are flashed yellow and if it is intended that a permissive turn movement not requiring a full stop by each turning vehicle be provided during the flashing mode.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section4G04">Section 4G.04 Flashing Operation – Transition Out of Flashing Mode</h3>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4G04_para01">01</span><span class="standard">All changes from flashing mode to steady (stop-and-go) mode shall be made under one of the following procedures:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="standard">
      <li>Yellow-red flashing mode: Changes from flashing mode to steady (stop-and-go) mode shall be made at the beginning of the major-street green interval (when a green signal indication is displayed to through traffic in both directions on the major street), or if there is no common major-street green interval, at the beginning of the green interval for the major traffic movement on the major street.</li>

      <li>Red-red flashing mode: Changes from flashing mode to steady (stop-and-go) mode shall be made by changing the flashing red indications to steady red indications followed by appropriate green indications to begin the steady mode cycle. These green indications shall be the beginning of the major-street green interval (when a green signal indication is displayed to through traffic in both directions on the major street) or if there is no common major-street green interval, at the beginning of the green interval for the major traffic movement on the major street.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4G04_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">The steady red clearance interval provided during the change from red-red flashing mode to steady (stop-and-go) mode should have a minimum duration of 6 seconds.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section4G04_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">When changing from the yellow-red flashing mode to steady (stop-and-go) mode at a location where there is a common major-street green interval, the flashing red signal indications for the minor street should immediately change to steady red indications, and the flashing yellow signal indications for the through movements on the major street should change to green indications in both directions (after the minor-street signal indications have been steady red for a short time, if desired), or the flashing yellow signal indications for the through movements on the major street should change to steady yellow signal indications followed by a steady red clearance interval before changing to green signal indications in both directions.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4G04_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">When changing from the yellow-red flashing mode to steady (stop-and-go) modeat a location where there is no common major-street green interval, the flashing red signal indications for the minor street should immediately change to steady red indications, and the flashing yellow signal indications for the through movements on the major street should change to steady yellow signal indications followed by a steady red clearance interval before changing to green signal indications for the major traffic movement on the major street.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4G04_para05">05</span><span class="standard">During programmed changes out of flashing mode, no flashing yellow signal indication shall be terminated and immediately followed by a steady red or flashing red signal indication without first displaying a steady yellow signal indication.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4G04_para06">06</span><span class="option">Because special midblock signals that rest in flashing circular yellow in the position normally occupied by the green signal indication do not have a green signal indication in the signal face, these signals may go directly from flashing circular yellow (in the position normally occupied by the green signal indication) to steady yellow without going first to a green signal indication.</span></p>
