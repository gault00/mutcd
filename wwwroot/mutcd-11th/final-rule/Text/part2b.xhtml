Setting appropriate speed limits is especially important to ensure safety for all road users in varying types of contexts, particularly on roadways where adjacent land use suggests that trips could be served by varied modes. These situations include urban and suburban non-freeway arterials or rural arterials that serve as main streets in smaller communities, consistent with the context classifications of urban core, urban, suburban, and rural towns found in “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets,” 2018 Edition, AASHTO. When setting a speed limit, a range of factors such as land-use context, pedestrian and bicyclist activity, crash history, intersection spacing, driveway density, roadway geometry, roadside conditions, roadway functional classification, traffic volume, and observed speeds can influence the speed limit determined in the engineering study. The engineering study will determine which of the recommended factors will prevail in setting the speed limit.</span></p>

		<li>Geographic context (such as an urban district, rural town center, non-urbanized rural area, or suburban area), and multi-modal trip generation;</li>

		<li>Reported crash experience for at least a 12-month period;</li>

		<li>Speed distribution of free-flowing vehicles including the pace, median (50th-percentile), and 85th-<span class="known_error_deleted">precentile</span><span class="known_error_added">percentile</span> speeds; and</li>

		<li>A review of past speed studies to identify any trends in operating speeds.</li>
    </ol>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2B21_para08">08</span><span class="guidance">When the 85th-percentile speed is appreciably greater than the posted speed limit, and the roadway context does not support setting a higher speed limit, the engineering study should consider whether changes to geometric features, enforcement, and/or other speed-reduction countermeasures might improve compliance with the posted speed limit. A similar approach should be used if the results of past speed studies indicate that the 85th-percentile speed has consistently increased.</span></p>
