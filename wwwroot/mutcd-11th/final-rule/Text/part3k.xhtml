    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section3K01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Longitudinal rumble strips consist of a series of rough-textured or slightly raised or depressed road surfaces intended to alert inattentive drivers through vibration and sound that their vehicle has left the travel lane. Shoulder rumble strips are typically installed along the shoulder near the travel lane. On divided highways, rumble strips are sometimes installed on the median side (left-hand side) shoulder as well as on the outside (right-hand side) shoulder. On two-way roadways, rumble strips are sometimes installed along the center line.</span></p>

The provisions in this Manual address the use of markings in combination with a longitudinal rumble strip. <a href="#figure3K01">Figure 3K-1</a> illustrates markings used with or near longitudinal rumble strips.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section3K02_para01">01</span><span class="support">Transverse rumble strips consist of intermittent narrow, transverse areas of rough-textured or slightly raised or depressed road surface that extend across the travel lanes to alert drivers to unusual vehicular traffic conditions. Through noise and vibration, they attract the attention of road users to features such as unexpected changes in alignment and conditions requiring a reduction in speed or a stop.</span></p>
