    <h3 id="section2E01">Section 2E.01 Scope of Freeway and Expressway Guide Sign Standards</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2E01_para01">01</span><span class="support">The provisions of this Chapter provide a uniform and effective system of signing for high-volume, high-speed motor vehicle traffic on freeways and expressways. The requirements and specifications for expressway signing exceed those for conventional roads (see <a href="part2d.xhtml">Chapter 2D</a>), but are less than those for freeway signing. Since there are many geometric design variables to be found in existing roads, a signing concept commensurate with prevailing conditions is the primary consideration. <a href="part1c.xhtml#section1C02">Section 1C.02</a> includes definitions of freeway and expressway.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2E01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Guide signs for freeways and expressways are primarily identified by the name of the sign rather than by an assigned sign designation. Guidelines for the design of guide signs for freeways and expressways are provided in the “Standard Highway Signs” publication (see <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A05">Section 1A.05</a>).</span></p>

    <h3 id="section2E02">Section 2E.02 Freeway and Expressway Signing Principles</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2E02_para01">01</span><span class="support">The development of a signing system for freeways and expressways is approached on the premise that the signing is primarily for the benefit and direction of road users who are unfamiliar with the route or area. The signing furnishes road users with clear instructions for orderly progress to their destinations. Sign installations are an integral part of the facility and, as such, are best planned concurrently with the development of highway location and geometric design. For optimal results, plans for signing are analyzed during the earliest stages of preliminary design, and details are correlated as final design is developed. The excessive signing found on many major highways usually is the result of using a multitude of signs that are too small and that are poorly designed and placed to accomplish the intended purpose.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2E02_para02">02</span><span class="support">Freeway and expressway signing is to be considered and developed as a planned system of installations. An engineering study is sometimes necessary for proper solution of the problems of many individual locations, but, in addition, consideration of an entire route is necessary.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2E02_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Road users should be guided with consistent signing on the approaches to interchanges, when they drive from one State to another, and when driving through rural or urban areas. Because geographical, geometric, and operating factors regularly create significant differences between urban and rural conditions, the signing should take these conditions into account.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2E02_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">Guide signs on freeways and expressways should serve distinct functions as follows:</span></p>

    <ol type="A">
      <li class="guidance">Give directions to destinations, or to streets or highway routes, at intersections or interchanges;</li>

      <li class="guidance">Furnish advance notice of the approach to intersections or interchanges;</li>

      <li class="guidance">Direct road users into appropriate lanes in advance of diverging or merging movements;</li>

      <li class="guidance">Identify routes and directions on those routes;</li>

      <li class="guidance">Show distances to destinations;</li>

      <li class="guidance">Indicate access to general motorist services, rest, scenic, and recreational areas; and</li>

      <li class="guidance">Provide other information of navigational value to the road user.</li>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2E04_para01">01</span><span class="support">Urban conditions are characterized not so much by city limits or other arbitrary boundaries, as by the following features:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="support">
      <li>Mainline roadways with more than two lanes in each direction;</li>
      <li>High traffic volumes on the through roadways;</li>

    </ol>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2E04_para02">02</span><span class="support">Operating conditions and road geometrics on urban freeways and expressways usually make special sign treatments desirable, including:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="support">
      <li>Use of Interchange Sequence signs (see <a href="#section2E24">Section 2E.24</a>);</li>
      <li>Use of sign spreading to the maximum extent possible (see <a href="#section2E43">Section 2E.43</a>);</li>
      <li>Elimination of General Service or Specific Service signing (see <a href="part2i.xhtml">Chapters 2I</a> and <a href="part2j.xhtml">2J</a>);</li>
      <li>Reduction to a minimum of post-interchange signs (see <a href="#section2E47">Section 2E.47</a>);</li>
      <li>Display of advance signs at distances closer to the interchange, with appropriate adjustments in the legend (see <a href="#section2E23">Section 2E.23</a>);</li>
      <li>Use of overhead signs on roadway structures and independent sign supports (see <a href="#section2E19">Section 2E.19</a>);</li>
      <li>Use of Overhead Arrow-per-Lane guide signs in advance of interchanges with option lanes (see <a href="#section2E40">Section 2E.40</a>, or Diagrammatic Advance guide signs in advance of interchanges with complex geometric configurations of ramp departures (see <a href="#section2E41">Section 2E.41</a>)); and</li>
      <li>Frequent use of street names as the principal message in guide signs.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2E04_para03">03</span><span class="support">Lower speeds, which are often characteristic of urban operations, do not justify lower signing standards. Typical traffic patterns are more complex for the road user to negotiate, and large, easy-to-read legends are, therefore, just as necessary as on rural highways.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section2E05">Section 2E.05 Characteristics of Rural Signing</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2E05_para01">01</span><span class="support">Rural areas ordinarily have greater distances between interchanges, which permits adequate spacing for the sequences of signs on the approach to and departure from each interchange. However, the absence of traffic in adjoining lanes and on entering or exiting ramps often adds monotony or inattention to rural driving. This increases the importance of signs that call for decisions or actions.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2E05_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">Where there are long distances between interchanges and the alignment is relatively unchanging, signs should be positioned for their best effect on road users. The tendency to group all signing in the immediate vicinity of rural interchanges should be avoided by considering the entire route in the development of signing plans. Extra effort should be given to the placement of signs at natural target locations to command the attention of the road user, particularly when the message requires an action by the road user.</span></p>
