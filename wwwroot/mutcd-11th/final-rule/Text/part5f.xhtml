    <h1>Chapter 5F. Traffic Control For Highway-Rail Grade Crossings</h1>

    <h3 id="section5F01">Section 5F.01 Introduction</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section5F01_para01">01</span><span class="support">The provisions for highway-rail grade crossing traffic control devices are contained in <a href="part8_toc.html">Part 8</a> and in other Sections of this Manual.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section5F01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Traffic control for highway-rail grade crossings includes all signs, signals, markings, illumination, and other warning devices and their supports along roadways either approaching or at highway-rail grade crossings. The purpose of this traffic control is to promote a safer and more efficient operation of both rail and highway traffic at highway-rail grade crossings.</span></p>
