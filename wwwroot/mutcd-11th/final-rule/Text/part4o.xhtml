    <h3 id="section4O01">Section 4O.01 Application of Traffic Control Signals for One-Lane, Two-Way Facilities</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4O01_para01">01</span><span class="support">A traffic control signal at a narrow bridge, tunnel, or roadway section that is not of sufficient width for two opposing vehicles to pass is a special signal that alternates which direction of travel is permitted to proceed.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section4O01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Temporary traffic control signals (see <a href="part4d.xhtml#section4D11">Sections 4D.11</a> and <a href="part6l.xhtml#section6L01">6L.01</a>) are the most frequent application of traffic control signals for one-lane, two-way facilities.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4O01_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Sight distance across or through the one-lane, two-way facility should be considered as well as the approach speed and sight distance approaching the facility when determining whether traffic control signals should be installed.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4O01_para04">04</span><span class="option">At a narrow bridge, tunnel, or roadway section where a traffic control signal is not justified under the conditions of <a href="part4c.xhtml">Chapter 4C</a>, a traffic control signal may be used if gaps in opposing traffic do not permit the flow of traffic through the one-lane section of roadway.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section4O02">Section 4O.02 Design of Traffic Control Signals for One-Lane, Two-Way Facilities</h3>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4O02_para01">01</span><span class="standard">The provisions of <a href="part4d.xhtml">Chapters 4D</a> through <a href="part4m.xhtml">4G</a> shall apply to traffic control signals for one-lane, two-way facilities, except that:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="standard">
      <li>The durations of red clearance intervals shall be adequate to clear the one-lane section of conflicting vehicles; and</li>

      <li>Adequate means, such as interconnection, shall be provided to prevent conflicting signal indications, such as green and green, at opposite ends of the section.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="section4O03">Section 4O.03 Operation of Traffic Control Signals for One-Lane, Two-Way Facilities</h3>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4O03_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">Traffic control signals at one-lane, two-way facilities should operate in a manner consistent with traffic requirements.</span></p>

	<p><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section4O03_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">Adequate time should be provided to allow traffic to clear the narrow facility before opposing traffic is allowed to move. Engineering judgment should be used to determine the proper timing for the signal.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/><span class="paranum" id="section4O03_para03">03</span><span class="standard">When in the flashing mode, the signal indications shall flash red.</span></p>
