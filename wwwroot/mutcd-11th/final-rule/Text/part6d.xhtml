    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D01_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">Because flaggers are responsible for public safety and make the greatest number of contacts with the public of all highway workers, they should be trained in proper traffic control practices and public contact techniques. Flaggers should be able to satisfactorily demonstrate the following abilities:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="guidance">
      <li>Ability to receive and communicate specific instructions clearly, firmly, and courteously;</li>

      <li>Ability to move and maneuver quickly in order to avoid danger from errant vehicles;</li>

      <li>Ability to control signaling devices (such as paddles and flags) in order to provide clear and positive guidance to drivers approaching a TTC zone in frequently changing situations;</li>

      <li>Ability to understand and apply proper traffic control practices, sometimes in stressful or emergency situations; and</li>

      <li>Ability to recognize dangerous traffic situations and warn workers in sufficient time to avoid injury.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D02_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">The STOP/SLOW paddle (see <a href="#figure6D01">Figure 6D-1</a> and <a href="part6g.xhtml#table6G01">Table 6G-1</a>) should be the primary and preferred hand-signaling device because the STOP/SLOW paddle gives road users more positive guidance than red flags.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D02_para02">02</span><span class="standard">The STOP/SLOW paddle (R1-1 and W20-8) shall have an octagonal shape on a rigid handle.

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D02_para05">05</span><span class="support">The optimum method of displaying a STOP or SLOW message is to place the STOP/SLOW paddle on a rigid staff that is tall enough that when the end of the staff is resting on the ground, the message is high enough to be seen by approaching or stopped traffic.</span></p>

The flashing lights may be arranged in any of the following patterns:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="option">
      <li>Two white or red lights, one centered vertically above and one centered vertically below the STOP legend; and/or two white or yellow lights, one centered vertically above and one centered vertically below the SLOW legend;</li>

      <li>One white or red light centered below the STOP legend; and/or one white or yellow light centered below the SLOW legend;</li>

      <li>A series of eight or more small white or red lights no larger than 1/4 inch in diameter along the outer edge of the paddle, arranged in an octagonal pattern at the eight corners of the border of the STOP face; and/or a series of eight or more small white or yellow lights no larger than 1/4 inch in diameter along the outer edge of the paddle, arranged in a diamond pattern along the border of the SLOW face; or</li>

      <li>A series of white lights forming the shapes of the letters in the legend.</li>

    <ol type="A" class="standard">
      <li>To inform road users to stop, the flagger shall hold the flashlight with the left arm extended and pointed down toward the ground, and then shall slowly wave the flashlight in front of the body in a slow arc from left to right such that the arc reaches no farther than 45 degrees from vertical.</li>

      <li>To inform road users to proceed, the flagger shall point the flashlight at the vehicle’s bumper, slowly aim the flashlight toward the open lane, then hold the flashlight in that position. The flagger shall not wave the flashlight.</li>

The use of hand movements alone without a paddle, flag, or AFAD to control road users shall be prohibited when controlling traffic in a one-lane two-way operation except when the control is provided by emergency responders at incident scenes as described in <a href="part6o.xhtml#section6O01">Section 6O.01</a> or provided by uniformed law enforcement officers.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6D05_para03">03</span><span class="standard">The following methods of signaling with a paddle shall be used:</span></p>

      <li>To direct stopped road users to proceed, the flagger shall face road users with the SLOW paddle face aimed toward road users in a stationary position with the arm extended horizontally away from the body. The flagger shall motion with the free hand for road users to proceed.</li>

      <li>To stop road users, the flagger shall face road users and extend the flag staff horizontally across the road users’ lane in a stationary position so that the full area of the flag is visibly hanging below the staff.

      <li>To direct stopped road users to proceed, the flagger shall face road users with the flag and arm lowered from the view of the road users, and shall motion with the free hand for road users to proceed. Flags shall not be used to signal road users to proceed.</li>

      <li>To alert or slow traffic, the flagger shall face road users and slowly wave the flag in a sweeping motion of the extended arm from shoulder level to straight down without raising the arm above a horizontal position. The flagger shall keep the free hand down.</li>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D05_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">The flagger should stand either on the shoulder adjacent to the road user being controlled or in the closed lane prior to stopping road users. A flagger should only stand in the lane being used by moving road users after road users have stopped. The flagger should be clearly visible to the first approaching road user at all times. The flagger also should be visible to other road users. The flagger should be stationed sufficiently in advance of the workers to warn them (for example, with audible warning devices such as horns or whistles) of approaching danger by out-of-control vehicles. The flagger should stand alone, away from other workers, work vehicles, or equipment.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6D05_para07">07</span><span class="option">In certain conditions, it may be more appropriate for a flagger to use a STOP/STOP or a SLOW/SLOW paddle to convey the appropriate message to approaching road users and avoid confusing those that are approaching the operation from the opposing direction.</span></p>
