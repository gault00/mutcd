    <h3 id="section6B01">Section 6B.01 Temporary Traffic Control Plans</h3>

	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Each TTC zone is different. Many variables, such as location of work, highway type, geometrics, vertical and horizontal alignment, intersections, interchanges, road user volumes, road user mix (motorists, bicyclists, and pedestrians), road vehicle mix (buses, trucks, and cars), and road user speeds affect the needs of each zone. The goal of TTC in work zones is safety with minimum disruption to road users. The key factor in promoting TTC zone safety is proper judgment.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para02">02</span><span class="support">A TTC plan describes TTC measures to be used for facilitating road users through a work zone or an incident area. TTC plans play a vital role in facilitating road user flow when a work zone, incident, or other event temporarily disrupts normal road user flow. Important auxiliary provisions that cannot conveniently be specified on project plans can easily be incorporated into Special Provisions within the TTC plan.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para03">03</span><span class="support">TTC plans range in scope from being very detailed to simply referencing typical drawings contained in this Manual, standard approved highway agency drawings and manuals, or specific drawings contained in the contract documents. The degree of detail in the TTC plan depends entirely on the nature and complexity of the situation.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para04">04</span><span class="support">During TTC activities, commercial vehicles might need to follow a different route from passenger vehicles because of bridge, weight, clearance, or geometric restrictions. Also, vehicles carrying hazardous materials might need to follow a different route from other vehicles. The Hazardous Materials and National Network signs are included in <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B67">Sections 2B.67</a> and <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B68">2B.68</a>, respectively.</span></p>

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para05">05</span><span class="guidance">A TTC plan should be developed planned activities that will affect road users. A TTC plan should be developed for unplanned and emergency situations where practicable.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">The TTC plan should start in the planning phase and continue through the design, construction, and restoration phases. The TTC plans and devices should follow the principles set forth in Part 6. The management of traffic incidents should follow the principles set forth in <a href="part6o.xhtml">Chapter 6O</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para07">07</span><span class="guidance">TTC plans should be prepared by persons knowledgeable (for example, trained and/or certified) about the fundamental principles of TTC and work activities to be performed. The design, selection, and placement of TTC devices for a TTC plan should be based on engineering judgment.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para08">08</span><span class="guidance">Coordination should be made between adjacent or overlapping projects to check that duplicate signing is not used and to check compatibility of traffic control between adjacent or overlapping projects.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para09">09</span><span class="guidance">Traffic control planning should be completed for all highway construction, utility work, maintenance operations, and incident management including minor maintenance and utility projects prior to occupying the TTC zone. Planning for all road users should be included in the process.</span></p>

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para10">10</span><span class="guidance">For any planned special event that will have an impact on the traffic on any street or highway, a TTC plan should be developed in conjunction with and be approved by the agency or agencies that have jurisdiction over the affected roadways.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para11">11</span><span class="guidance">Provisions for effective continuity of accessible circulation paths for pedestrians should be incorporated into the TTC plan.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para12">12</span><span class="option">Provisions may be incorporated into the project bid documents that enable contractors to develop an alternate TTC plan.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para13">13</span><span class="option">Modifications of TTC plans may be necessary because of changed conditions or a determination of better methods of safely and efficiently handling road users.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para14">14</span><span class="guidance">This alternate or modified plan should have the approval of the responsible highway agency or owner of site roadways open to public travel prior to implementation.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para15">15</span><span class="guidance">Provisions for effective continuity of transit service should be incorporated into the TTC planning process because often public transit buses cannot efficiently be detoured in the same manner as other vehicles (particularly for short-term maintenance projects). Where applicable, the TTC plan should provide for features such as accessible temporary bus stops, pull-outs, and satisfactory waiting areas for transit patrons, including persons with disabilities, (see <a href="part8a.xhtml#section8A13">Section 8A.13</a> for additional light rail transit issues to consider for TTC).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para16">16</span><span class="guidance">Provisions for effective continuity of railroad service and acceptable access to abutting property owners and businesses should also be incorporated into the TTC planning process.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para17">17</span><span class="guidance">Reduced speed zoning (lowering the regulatory speed limit) should be avoided as much as practical because drivers will reduce their speeds only if they clearly perceive a need to do so.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para18">18</span><span class="guidance">If reduced speed limits are used, they should be used only in the specific portion of the TTC zone where conditions or restrictive features are present. However, frequent changes in the speed limit should be avoided. A TTC plan should be designed so that vehicles can travel through the TTC zone with a speed limit reduction of no more than 10 mph.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para19">19</span><span class="guidance">A reduction of more than 10 mph in the speed limit should be used only when required by restrictive features in the TTC zone. Where restrictive features justify a speed reduction of more than 10 mph, additional driver notification should be provided. The speed limit should be stepped down in advance of the location requiring the lowest speed, and additional TTC warning devices should be used.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para20">20</span><span class="support">Research has demonstrated that large reductions in the speed limit, such as a 30 mph reduction, increase speed variance and the potential for crashes. Smaller reductions in the speed limit of up to 10 mph cause smaller changes in speed variance and lessen the potential for increased crashes. A reduction in the regulatory speed limit of only up to 10 mph from the normal speed limit has been shown to be more effective.</span></p>
	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para21">21</span><span class="support"><a href="part6p.xhtml">Chapter 6P</a> contains typical applications (TAs) of TTC zones that are organized according to duration, location, type of work, and highway type. <a href="part6p.xhtml#table6P01">Table 6P-1</a> is an index of these typical applications. These typical applications include the use of various TTC methods, but do not include a layout for every conceivable work situation.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para22">22</span><span class="support">Decisions regarding the selection of the most appropriate typical application to use as a guide for a specific TTC zone require an understanding of each situation. Although there are many ways of categorizing TTC zone applications, the typical applications illustrated in <a href="part6p.xhtml">Chapter 6P</a> are characterized by work duration, work location, work type, and highway type.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section6B01_para27">27</span><span class="support">Well-designed TTC plans for planned special events will likely be developed from a combination of treatments from several of the typical applications.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section6B02">Section 6B.02 Temporary Traffic Control Zones</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B02_para01">01</span><span class="support">A TTC zone is an area of a highway where road user conditions are changed because of a work zone, an incident zone, or a planned special event through the use of TTC devices, uniformed law enforcement officers, or other authorized personnel.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B02_para02">02</span><span class="support">A work zone is an area of a highway with construction, maintenance, or utility work activities. A work zone is typically marked by signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, and/or work vehicles. It extends from the first warning sign or high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the END ROAD WORK sign or the last TTC device.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B02_para03">03</span><span class="support">An incident zone is an area of a highway where temporary traffic controls are imposed by authorized officials in response to a traffic incident (see <a href="part6o.xhtml#section6O01">Section 6O.01</a>). It extends from the first warning device (such as a sign, light, or cone) to the last TTC device or to a point where road users return to the original lane alignment and are clear of the incident.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B02_para04">04</span><span class="support">A planned special event often creates the need to establish altered traffic patterns to handle the increased traffic volumes generated by the event. The size of the TTC zone associated with a planned special event can be small, such as closing a street for a festival, or can extend throughout a municipality for larger events. The duration of the TTC zone is determined by the duration of the planned special event.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section6B03">Section 6B.03 Components of Temporary Traffic Control Zones</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B03_para01">01</span><span class="support">A TTC zone is often divided into four areas as needed, based on engineering judgment: the advance warning area, the transition area, the activity area, and the termination area. <a href="#figure6B01">Figure 6B-1</a> illustrates the four areas typically included in a TTC zone. These four areas are described in <a href="#section6B04">Sections 6B.04</a> through <a href="#section6B07">6B.07</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B04_para01">01</span><span class="support">The advance warning area is the section of highway where road users are informed about the upcoming transition and activity areas or incident area.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B04_para02">02</span><span class="option">The advance warning area may vary from a single sign or high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to a series of signs in advance of the TTC zone activity area.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6B04_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Typical distances for placement of advance warning signs on freeways and expressways should be longer because drivers are conditioned to uninterrupted flow. Therefore, the advance warning sign placement should extend on these facilities as far as 1/2 mile or more.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6B04_para04">04</span><span class="guidance"> On urban streets, the effective placement of the nearest warning sign to the TTC zone, in feet, should range from 4 to 8 times the speed limit in mph, with the high end of the range being used when speeds are relatively high. When two or more advance warning signs are used on higher-speed streets, such as major arterials, the advance warning area should extend a greater distance (see <a href="#table6B01">Table 6B-1</a>).</span></p>
