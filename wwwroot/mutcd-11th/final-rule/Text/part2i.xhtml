Interstate Oasis guide signs inform road users on Interstate highways as to the presence of an Interstate Oasis at an interchange and which businesses have been designated by the State within which they are traveling as having met the eligibility criteria of the Federal Highway Administration’s Interstate Oasis policy. The FHWA’s policy, which is dated October 18, 2006, and which can be viewed on the MUTCD Web site at http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/res-policy.htm, provides a more detailed definition of an Interstate Oasis and specifies the eligibility criteria for an Interstate Oasis designation in compliance with the requirements of laws enacted by Congress.</span></p>
