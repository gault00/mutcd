    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6N01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Work duration is a major factor in determining the number and types of devices used in TTC zones. The duration of a TTC zone is defined relative to the length of time a work operation occupies a spot location.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6N01_para02">02</span><span class="standard">The five categories of work duration and their time at a location shall be defined as follows:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="standard">
      <li>Long-term stationary is work that occupies a location more than 3 days.</li>

      <li>Intermediate-term stationary is work that occupies a location more than one daylight period up to 3 days, or nighttime work lasting more than 1 hour.</li>

      <li>Short-term stationary is daytime work that occupies a location for more than 1 hour within a single daylight period.</li>

      <li>Short duration is work that occupies a location up to 1 hour.</li>

      <li>Mobile is work that moves intermittently or continuously.</li>

Larger channelizing devices, temporary roadways, and temporary traffic barriers are frequently used.</span></p>

The increased time to place and remove these devices in some cases could significantly lengthen the project, thus increasing exposure time.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6N01_para08">08</span><span class="support">As compared to stationary operations, mobile and short-duration operations are activities that might involve different treatments. Devices having greater mobility might be necessary such as signs mounted on trucks. Devices that are larger, more imposing, or more visible can be used effectively and economically. The mobility of the TTC zone is important.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6N01_para09">09</span><span class="guidance">Safety in short-duration or mobile operations should not be compromised by using fewer devices simply because the operation will frequently change its location.</span></p>

    

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6N01_para10">10</span><span class="support">During short-duration work, it often takes longer to set up and remove the TTC zone than to perform the work. Workers face hazards in setting up and taking down the TTC zone. Also, since the work time is short, delays affecting road users are significantly increased when additional devices are installed and removed.</span></p>

	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6N01_para21">21</span><span class="support">A rolling roadblock is a method of TTC used to slow or stop traffic as a means of temporarily removing traffic from a roadway segment downstream of the road block. The rolling roadblock closes all lanes of traffic by using pacing vehicles to create a gap so that construction activities can be performed. Rolling roadblocks are used where long-term road closures using TTC devices are not needed. A rolling roadblock requires one blocking/pacing vehicle per lane of traffic, a clearing vehicle, and an advance warning vehicle. The rolling roadblock is normally performed by law enforcement officers during off-peak hours.</span></p>
