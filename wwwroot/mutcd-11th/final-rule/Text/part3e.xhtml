They might be barrier-separated or buffer-separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes, or they might be contiguous with the adjacent general-purpose lanes. Barrier-separated preferential lanes might be operated in a constant direction or be operated as reversible lanes. Some reversible preferential lanes on a divided highway might be operated counter-flow to the direction of traffic on the immediately adjacent general purpose lanes. <a href="part1c.xhtml#section1C02">Section 1C.02</a> contains definitions of these terms.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section3E02_para02">02</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes might be operated full-time (24 hours per day on all days), for extended periods of the day, part-time (restricted usage during specific hours on specified days), or on a variable basis (such as a strategy for a managed lane).</span></p>
