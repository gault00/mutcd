    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Pavement markings are installed or existing markings are maintained or enhanced in TTC zones to provide road users with a clearly defined path for travel through the TTC zone in day, night, and twilight periods under both wet and dry pavement conditions.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J01_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">The work should be planned and staged to provide for the placement and removal of the pavement markings in a way that minimizes the disruption to traffic flow approaching and through the TTC zone during the placement and removal process.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J01_para03">03</span><span class="standard">Existing pavement markings shall be maintained in all long-term stationary (see <a href="part6n.xhtml#section6N01">Section 6N.01</a>) TTC zones in accordance with <a href="part3a.xhtml">Chapters 3A</a> and <a href="part3b.xhtml">3B</a>, except as otherwise provided for temporary pavement markings in <a href="#section6J02">Section 6J.02</a>. Pavement markings shall match the alignment of the markings in place at both ends of the TTC zone. Pavement markings shall be placed along the entire length of any paved detour or temporary roadway prior to the detour or roadway being opened to road users.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J01_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">For long-term stationary operations, pavement markings in the temporary traveled way that are no longer applicable should be removed or obliterated as soon as practical. Pavement marking obliteration should remove the non-applicable pavement marking material, and the obliteration method should minimize pavement scarring.</span></p>

	<p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J01_para05">05</span><span class="standard">Painting over existing pavement markings with black paint or spraying with asphalt shall not be accepted as a substitute for removal or obliteration.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J01_para06">06</span><span class="option">Removable, non-reflective, preformed tape that is approximately the same color as the pavement surface may be used where markings need to be covered temporarily.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section6J02">Section 6J.02 Temporary Markings</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para01">01</span><span class="support">Temporary markings are those pavement markings or devices that are placed within TTC zones to provide road users with a clearly defined path of travel through the TTC zone when the permanent markings are either removed or obliterated during the work activities. Temporary markings are typically needed during the reconstruction of a road while it is open to traffic, such as overlays or surface treatments or where lanes are temporarily shifted on pavement that is to remain in place.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">Unless justified based on engineering judgment, temporary pavement markings should not remain in place for more than 14 daysafter the application of the pavement surface treatment or the construction of the final pavement surface on new roadways or over existing pavements.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">The temporary use of edge lines, channelizing lines, lane-reduction transitions, gore markings, and other longitudinal markings, and the various non-longitudinal markings (such as stop lines, railroad crossings, crosswalks, words, symbols, or arrows) should be in accordance with the State’s or highway agency’s policy.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para04">04</span><span class="standard">Warning signs, channelizing devices, and delineation shall be used to indicate required road user paths in TTC zones where it is not possible to provide a clear path by pavement markings.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para05">05</span><span class="standard">Except as otherwise provided in this Section, all temporary pavement markings for no-passing zones shall comply with the requirements of Chapters 3A and 3B. All temporary broken-line pavement markings shall use the same cycle length as permanent markings and shall have line segments that are at least 2 feet long.</span></p>

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">All pavement markings and devices used to delineate road user paths should be reviewed during daytime and nighttime periods.</span></p>

    <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para07">07</span><span class="option">Half-cycle lengths with a minimum of 2-foot stripes may be used on roadways with severe curvature (see <a href="part3a.xhtml#section3A04">Section 3A.04</a>) for broken line center lines in passing zones and for lane lines.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6J02_para08">08</span><span class="option">For temporary situations of 14 days or less, for a two- or three-lane road, no-passing zones may be identified by using DO NOT PASS (R4-1), PASS WITH CARE (R4-2), and NO PASSING ZONE (W14-3) signs (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B36">Sections 2B.36</a>, <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B37">2B.37</a>, and <a href="part2c.xhtml#section2C53">2C.53</a>) rather than pavement markings. Also, DO NOT PASS, PASS WITH CARE, and NO PASSING ZONE signs may be used instead of pavement markings on roads with low volumes for longer periods in accordance with the State’s or highway agency’s policy.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section6J03_para06">06</span><span class="guidance">Raised pavement markers should be considered for use along surfaced detours or temporary roadways, and other changed or new travel-lane alignments.</span></p>
