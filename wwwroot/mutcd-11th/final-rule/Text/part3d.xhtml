    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span> <br/> <span class="paranum" id="section3D01_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">Pavement markings and signing for a circular intersection should be integrally designed to correspond to the geometric design and intended lane use of a circular intersection.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section3D01_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">Markings on the approaches to a circular intersection and on the circular roadway should be compatible with each other to provide a consistent message to road users. The markings should supplement the signing, both conveying the optional and mandatory movements such that road users will know to choose the proper lane in the approach to the circular intersection and remain in that lane throughout departure from the circulatory roadway.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section3D01_para03">03</span><span class="support">Common circular intersection types include roundabouts, rotaries, and traffic circles (see definitions in <a href="part1c.xhtml#section1C02">Section 1C.02</a>). Traffic circles and rotaries are often much larger than roundabouts. Modern roundabouts feature channelized, curved approaches that reduce vehicle speed. Traffic calming circles are smaller and are typically used on urban or suburban neighborhood streets.</span></p>
