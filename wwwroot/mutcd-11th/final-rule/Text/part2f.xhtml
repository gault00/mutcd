    <h1>Chapter 2F. Toll Road Signs</h1>


<h2>General</h2>


    <h3 id="section2F01">Section 2F.01 Scope</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2F01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Toll highways are typically limited-access freeway or expressway facilities. A portion of or an entire route might be a toll highway, or a bridge, tunnel, or other crossing point might be the only toll portion of a highway at which a toll is collected.. A toll highway might be a conventional road. The general signing requirements for toll roads will depend on the type of facility and access (freeway, expressway, or conventional road). The provisions of Chapters 2D and 2E will generally apply for guide signs along the toll facility that direct road users within and off the facility where exit points and geometric configurations are not dependent specifically on the collection of tolls. The aspect of tolling and the presence of toll plazas or collection points necessitate additional considerations in the typical signing needs. The notification of the collection of tolls in advance of and at entry points to the toll highway also necessitate additional modifications to the typical signing.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2F01_para02">02</span><span class="support">The scope of this Section applies to a route or facility on which all lanes are tolled. Chapter 2G contains provisions for the signing of managed lanes within an otherwise non-toll facility that employ tolling or pricing as an operational strategy to manage congestion levels.</span></p>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2F01_para03">03</span><span class="standard">Except where specifically provided in this Chapter, the provisions of other Chapters in Part 2 shall apply to toll roads.</span></p>
