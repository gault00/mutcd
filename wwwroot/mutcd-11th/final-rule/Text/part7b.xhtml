    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7B02_para01">01</span><span class="support">Many state and local jurisdictions find it beneficial to advise road users that they are approaching a school that is adjacent to a highway, where additional care is needed, even though no school crossing is involved and the speed limit remains unchanged. Additionally, some jurisdictions designate school zones that have a unique legal standing in that fines for speeding or other traffic violations within designated school zones are increased or special enforcement techniques such as photo radar systems are used. It is important and sometimes legally necessary to mark the beginning and end points of these designated school zones so that the road user is given proper notice.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7B02_para02">02</span><span class="support">The School (S1-1) sign (see <a href="#figure7B01">Figure 7B-1</a>) has the following four applications:</span></p>

   

    <ol type="A" class="support">
      <li>School Area - the S1-1 sign can be used to warn road users that they are approaching a school area that might include school buildings or grounds, a school crossing, or school related activity adjacent to the highway.</li>

      <li>School Zone - the S1-1 sign can be used to identify the location of the beginning of a designated school zone.</li>

      <li>School Advance Crossing - if combined with an AHEAD (W16-9P) plaque or an XX FEET (W16-2P or W16-2aP) plaque to comprise the School Advance Crossing assembly (see <a href="#figure7B01">Figure 7B-1</a>), the S1-1 sign can be used to warn road users that they are approaching a crossing where schoolchildren cross the roadway (see <a href="#section7B03">Section 7B.03</a>).</li>

      <li>School Crossing - if combined with a diagonal downward pointing arrow (W16-7P) plaque to comprise the School Crossing assembly (see <a href="#figure7B01">Figure 7B-1</a>), the S1-1 sign can be used to warn approaching road users of the location of a crossing where schoolchildren cross the roadway (see <a href="#section7B03">Section 7B.03</a>).</li>
