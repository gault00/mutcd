    <h1>Chapter 2G. Preferential and Managed Lane Signs</h1>


<h2>General</h2>


    <h3 id="section2G01">Section 2G.01 Scope</h3>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes are lanes designated for special traffic uses such as high-occupancy vehicles (HOVs), light rail, buses, or taxis. Preferential lane treatments might be as simple as restricting a turning lane to a certain class of vehicles during peak periods, or as sophisticated as providing a separate roadway system within a highway corridor for certain vehicles.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para02">02</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes might be barrier-separated (on a separate alignment or physically separated from the other travel lanes by a barrier or median), buffer-separated (separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes only by a narrow buffer area created with longitudinal pavement markings), or contiguous (separated from the adjacent general-purpose lanes only by a lane line). Preferential lanes might allow continuous access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes or restrict access only to designated locations. Preferential lanes might be operated in a constant direction or operated as reversible lanes. Some reversible preferential lanes on a divided highway might be operated counter-flow to the direction of traffic on the immediately adjacent general-purpose lanes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para03">03</span><span class="support">Preferential lanes might be operated on a 24-hour basis, for extended periods of the day, during peak travel periods only, during special events, or during other activities.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para04">04</span><span class="support">Open-road tolling lanes and toll plaza lanes that segregate traffic based on payment method are not considered preferential lanes. Chapter 2F contains information regarding signing of open-road tolling lanes and toll plaza lanes.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para05">05</span><span class="support">Managed lanes typically restrict access with the adjacent general-purpose lanes to designated locations only.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para06">06</span><span class="support">Under certain operational strategies, such as the occupancy requirement of an HOV lane changing in response to actual congestion levels, a managed lane is a special type of preferential lane (see <a href="#section2G03">Sections 2G.03</a> through <a href="#section2G07">2G.07</a>).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para07">07</span><span class="support">A managed lane operated on a real-time basis in response to changing conditions might be operated as an HOV lane for a period of time as needed to manage congestion levels.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para08">08</span><span class="support"><a href="#section2G17">Sections 2G.17</a> through <a href="#section2G19">2G.19</a> contain additional information regarding signs for managed lanes that use tolling or pricing as a management strategy.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para09">09</span><span class="support"><a href="part9b.xhtml#section9B04">Section 9B.04</a> contains information regarding Preferential Lane signs for bicycle lanes.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G01_para10">10</span><span class="standard">Unless otherwise provided, the provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to bicycle lanes.</span></p>
	

    <h3 id="section2G02">Section 2G.02 Sizes of Preferential and Managed Lane Signs</h3>

    <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G02_para01">01</span><span class="standard">Except as provided in <a href="part2a.xhtml#section2A07">Section 2A.07</a>, the minimum sizes of preferential and managed lane signs that have standardized designs shall be as shown in <a href="#table2G01">Table 2G-1</a>.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para01">01</span><span class="support">A priced managed lane is a managed lane that employs tolling or pricing, typically through electronic toll collection, to manage congestion levels and maintain a certain level of service for users of the facility. A priced managed facility typically provides a less congested alternative to adjacent lanes along the same designated route, or to a nearby facility, that experience recurring congestion during peak periods. A priced managed lane might allow non-toll travel by certain vehicles based on occupancy or other criteria. A variety of operational management strategies might be used in conjunction with tolling or pricing.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para02">02</span><span class="support">The number and combination of operational strategies that are applied to a managed lane to manage congestion or improve efficiency might be practically limited by the amount of information that can be legibly displayed on signs or in signing sequences and still be readily comprehended by road users. Such factors to consider when evaluating alternatives for managed lanes are locations of signs for general-purpose interchanges and for other roadway conditions, the number of intermediate access points between the managed and general-purpose lanes and the need to repeat the operational information, and the distance over which a signing sequence that displays all of the eligibility requirements can be displayed.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para03">03</span><span class="support">Because managed lanes have the capability to employ a variety of operational strategies on a changing basis, it is not practical to assign a naming convention to such lanes for the purpose of signing based on the specific operational management strategies, as is more readily accomplished with other types of preferential lanes, such as HOV, bus, or bicycle lanes. Instead, the various requirements, restrictions, and eligibility criteria are more appropriately conveyed through a sequence of regulatory and guide signs with a more encompassing designation for the purpose of providing directional information.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section2G17_para04">04</span><span class="support">As priced managed have lanes become prevalent as an operational strategy, it is important to maintain a uniform naming convention to distinguish those lanes that are an alternative to travel on adjacent general-purpose lanes on the same designated route to effectively communicate to motorists the range of basic requirements for similar facilities in different regions.</span></p>

Configurations might be on freeways and expressways, as well as on conventional roads. Travel on the shoulder during these periods might be restricted to certain classes of vehicles, such as buses or HOV, or might be open to general traffic. When the part-time travel on a shoulder is limited to certain classes of vehicles, the signing is similar to that for preferential lanes. Additional signing is typically used to advise road users that the shoulder is not available for emergency use during these periods. Part-time travel on a shoulder might also employ lane-use control signals and/or blank-out signs to inform traffic of the allowable use of the shoulder. Depending on the design of exit ramp terminals and auxiliary lanes, guide signs must account for exit maneuvers during both shoulder use conditions and might necessitate changeable legend elements. However, additional guide signs are not normally necessary specifically for the condition when the shoulder is used for travel. The pavement markings might also be modified where travel allowed on the shoulder begins and ends.</span></p>

When used for active lane management on a freeway or expressway, a steady YELLOW X signal indication shall be displayed to warn road users to vacate the lane when the next downstream lane-use control signal over the same lane is displaying a steady RED X signal indication.</span></p>

Closer spacing should be used where the viewing distance is limited by the roadway geometry, overcrossings or other sight obstructions, or where traffic entering from intervening interchange ramps is not adequately served by the 1/2-mile spacing.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2G25_para07">07</span><span class="guidance">Combining lane-use control signals with overhead sign support structures should be minimized to avoid overloading road users with too much information or conflicting or incorrect messages, such as exclusive lane use or lane drop implied by the display of a steady DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW signal indication below a guide sign.</span></p>

	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section2G26_para01">01</span><span class="support">Active traffic management on freeways and expressways might employ variable speed limits as an element of an overall congestion management plan using variable Speed Limit (R2-1) signs (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B21">Section 2B.21</a>).</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section2G26_para02">02</span><span class="support">Careful consideration is needed in locating variable Speed Limit signs along the roadway and potential positioning adjacent to guide signs or lane-use control signals so that the speed displayed is clearly associated with the lane or lanes intended to be regulated and not other adjacent lanes, ramps or roadways. This might result in the need to place variable Speed Limit signs on separate supports away from guide and other signs or lane-use control signals.</span></p>

The variable Speed Limit signs should be placed far enough in advance of known congestion points to adequately adjust the operating speed to minimize the extent of vehicle queuing.</span></p>
