    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum" id="section7A01_para01">01</span><span class="support">Part 7 sets forth basic principles and prescribes standards for the design, application, installation, and maintenance of all traffic control devices (including signs, signals, and markings) and other controls (including adult crossing guards) for the special pedestrian conditions in school areas.</span></p>

    <h3 id="section7A02">Section 7A.02 School Route Plans and School Crossings</h3>

	<p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">A school route plan for each school serving elementary to high school students should be prepared in order to develop uniformity in the use of school area traffic controls and to serve as the basis for a school traffic control plan for each school.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">The school route plan, developed in a systematic manner by the school, law enforcement, and traffic officials responsible for school pedestrian safety, should consist of a map (see <a href="#figure7A01">Figure 7A-1</a>) showing streets, the school, existing traffic controls, established school walk routes, and established school crossings.</span></p>

	<p><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Bicycle use as a mode of transportation, as applicable, should also be considered if students biking to and from school are not allowed to use sidewalks along the pedestrian route.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para04">04</span><span class="guidance">The type(s) of school area traffic control devices used, either warning or regulatory, should be related to the volume and speed of vehicular traffic, street width, and the number and age of the students using the crossing.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para05">05</span><span class="guidance">School area traffic control devices should be included in a school traffic control plan.</span></p>

    <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para06">06</span><span class="support">To establish a safer route to and from school for schoolchildren, the application of planning criterion for school walk routes might make it necessary for children to walk an indirect route to an established school crossing located where there is existing traffic control and to avoid the use of a direct crossing where there is no existing traffic control.</span></p>

	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para07">07</span><span class="support">The frequency of gaps in the traffic stream that are sufficient for student crossing is different at each crossing location. When the delay between the occurrences of adequate gaps becomes excessive, students might become impatient and endanger themselves by attempting to cross the street during an inadequate gap. In these instances, the creation of sufficient gaps needs to be considered to accommodate the crossing demand.</span></p>
	

    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para08">08</span><span class="guidance">School walk routes should be planned to take advantage of existing traffic controls.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para09">09</span><span class="guidance">The following factors should be considered when determining the feasibility of requiring children to walk a longer distance to a crossing with existing traffic control:</span></p>

    <ol type="A" class="guidance">
      <li>The availability of adequate sidewalks or other pedestrian walkways to and from the location with existing control,</li>

      <li>The number of students using the crossing,</li>

      <li>The age levels of the students using the crossing, and</li>

      <li>The total extra walking distance.</li>
    </ol>

	
	<p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7A02_para10">10</span><span class="support">A School Crossing signal warrant is provided in <a href="part4c.xhtml#section4C06">Section 4C.06</a>.</span></p>
