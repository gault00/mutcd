	<p><span class="paranum" id="section1B07_para04">04</span> <span class="support">The issuance by FHWA of an interim approval might result in the traffic control device or application being proposed for adoption in the next scheduled rulemaking process to issue a new edition or revision of this Manual. If the device or application under interim approval is not proposed in the next rulemaking for a new edition or revision, then a statement of the status of the interim approval, whether it is to be rescinded or remain in effect, will be included in the Federal Register notice for the rulemaking.</span></p>

   <p><span class="paranum" id="section1B07_para07">07</span><span class="support">Interim approval is ordinarily considered only after published authoritative research and experimentation sufficiently demonstrate that the device or application provides a significant safety or operational improvement. Individual experiments by various jurisdictions, without a research report on the overall findings of the experimental device or application, will not ordinarily qualify for issuance of an interim approval.</span></p>
	
	<p><span class="paranum" id="section1B07_para08">08</span><span class="support">Interim approval ordinarily is not considered based solely on non-U.S. experience with a new traffic control device or application. Differences in regulations, enforcement and penalties, and driver licensing requirements, among other factors, can result in dissimilar road-user behavior. Additionally, due to variations in conventions for traffic control device design, a non-U.S. traffic control device concept might need to be adapted to U.S. criteria to ensure consistency with the provisions and principles of this Manual. However, documented non-U.S. experience can be considered in the development of requests for experimentation (see <a href="#section1B05">Section 1B.05</a>) and within the evaluation plan for traffic control device research.</span></p>
