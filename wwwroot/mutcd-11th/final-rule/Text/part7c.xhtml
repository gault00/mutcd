    <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span><br/> </span><span class="paranum" id="section7C01_para01">01</span><span class="guidance">Crosswalks should be marked at all intersections on established routes to a school where there is substantial conflict between motorists, bicyclists, and student movements; where students are encouraged to cross between intersections; where students would not otherwise recognize the proper place to cross; or where motorists or bicyclists might not expect students to cross (see <a href="part7a.xhtml#figure7A01">Figure 7A-1</a>).</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7C01_para02">02</span><span class="guidance">An engineering study considering the factors described in <a href="part3c.xhtml#section3C02">Section 3C.02</a> should be performed before a marked crosswalk is installed at a location away from a traffic control signal or an approach controlled by a STOP or YIELD sign.</span></p>

    <p><span class="paranum" id="section7C01_para03">03</span><span class="guidance">Because non-intersection school crossings are generally unexpected by the road user, warning signs (see <a href="part7b.xhtml#section7B03">Sections 7B.03</a>) should be installed for all marked school crosswalks at non-intersection locations. Adequate visibility of students by approaching motorists and of approaching motorists by students should be provided by parking prohibitions or other appropriate measures.</span></p>
