          <span class="paranum"><a name="section1A02_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">This Manual contains the basic principles that govern the design and use of traffic control devices for all streets, highways, bikeways, and private roads open to public travel (see definition in <a href="#section1A13">Section 1A.13</a>) regardless of type or class or the public agency, official, or owner having jurisdiction. This Manual’s text specifies the restriction on the use of a device if it is intended for limited application or for a specific system. It is important that these principles be given primary consideration in the selection and application of each device.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section1A02_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="guidance">To be effective, a traffic control device should meet five basic requirements:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="guidance">
          <li>Fulfill a need;</li>
          <li>Command attention;</li>
          <li>Convey a clear, simple meaning;</li>
          <li>Command respect from road users; and</li>
          <li>Give adequate time for proper response.</li>

        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section1A02_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="guidance">Design, placement, operation, maintenance, and uniformity are aspects that should be carefully considered in order to maximize the ability of a traffic control device to meet the five requirements listed in the <a href="#section1A02_para02">previous paragraph</a>. Vehicle speed should be carefully considered as an element that governs the design, operation, placement, and location of various traffic control devices.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section1A02_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="support">The definition of the word “speed” varies depending on its use. The definitions of specific speed terms are contained in <a href="#section1A13">Section 1A.13</a>.</span></p>

Such statutes, ordinances, and resolutions should be consistent with the “Uniform Vehicle Code” (see <a href="#section1A11">Section 1A.11</a>).</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section1A02_para06"></a>06</span> <span class="guidance">The proper use of traffic control devices should provide the reasonable and prudent road user with the information necessary to efficiently and lawfully use the streets, highways, pedestrian facilities, and bikeways.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section1A04_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="guidance">Placement of a traffic control device should be within the road user’s view so that adequate visibility is provided. To aid in conveying the proper meaning, the traffic control device should be appropriately positioned with respect to the location, object, or situation to which it applies. The location and legibility of the traffic control device should be such that a road user has adequate time to make the proper response in both day and night conditions.</span></p>

        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section1A06_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Uniformity of devices simplifies the task of the road user because it aids in recognition and understanding, thereby reducing perception/reaction time. Uniformity assists road users, law enforcement officers, and traffic courts by giving everyone the same interpretation. Uniformity assists public highway officials through efficiency in manufacture, installation, maintenance, and administration. Uniformity means treating similar situations in a similar way. The use of uniform traffic control devices does not, in itself, constitute uniformity. A standard device used where it is not appropriate is as objectionable as a non-standard device; in fact, this might be worse, because such misuse might result in disrespect at those locations where the device is needed and appropriate.</span></p>

          <li>A statement indicating the nature of the problem.</li>
          <li>A description of the proposed change to the traffic control device or application of the traffic control device, how it was developed, the manner in which it deviates from the standard, and how it is expected to be an improvement over existing standards.</li>
          <li>Any illustration that would be helpful to understand the traffic control device or use of the traffic control device.</li>
          <li>Any supporting data explaining how the traffic control device was developed, if it has been tried, in what ways it was found to be adequate or inadequate, and how this choice of device or application was derived.</li>
          <li>A legally binding statement certifying that the concept of the traffic control device is not protected by a patent or copyright. (An example of a traffic control device concept would be countdown pedestrian signals in general. Ordinarily an entire general concept would not be patented or copyrighted, but if it were it would not be acceptable for experimentation unless the patent or copyright owner signs a waiver of rights acceptable to the FHWA. An example of a patented or copyrighted specific device within the general concept of countdown pedestrian signals would be a manufacturer’s design for its specific brand of countdown signal, including the design details of the housing or electronics that are unique to that manufacturer’s product. As long as the general concept is not patented or copyrighted, it is acceptable for experimentation to incorporate the use of one or more patented devices of one or several manufacturers.)</li>
          <li>The time period and location(s) of the experiment.</li>
          <li>A detailed research or evaluation plan that must provide for close monitoring of the experimentation, especially in the early stages of its field implementation. The evaluation plan should include before and after studies as well as quantitative data describing the performance of the experimental device.</li>
          <li>An agreement to restore the site of the experiment to a condition that complies with the provisions of this Manual within 3 months following the end of the time period of the experiment. This agreement must also provide that the agency sponsoring the experimentation will terminate the experimentation at any time that it determines significant safety concerns are directly or indirectly attributable to the experimentation. The FHWA’s Office of Transportation Operations has the right to terminate approval of the experimentation at any time if there is an indication of safety concerns. If, as a result of the experimentation, a request is made that this Manual be changed to include the device or application being experimented with, the device or application will be permitted to remain in place until an official rulemaking action has occurred.</li>
          <li>An agreement to provide semi-annual progress reports for the duration of the experimentation, and an agreement to provide a copy of the final results of the experimentation to the FHWA’s Office of Transportation Operations within 3 months following completion of the experimentation. The FHWA’s Office of Transportation Operations has the right to terminate approval of the experimentation if reports are not provided in accordance with this schedule.</li>
