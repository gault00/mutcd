          <span class="paranum"><a name="section8D01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Traffic control for pathway grade crossings includes all signs, signals, markings, other warning devices, and their supports at pathway grade crossings and along pathway approaches to grade crossings. The function of this traffic control is to promote safety and provide effective operation of both rail and pathway traffic at pathway grade crossings.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section8D01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Except as specifically provided in this Chapter, sidewalks are considered to be part of a highway-rail or highway-LRT grade crossing rather than a pathway grade crossing, and are covered by the provisions of <a href="part8b.xhtml">Chapters 8B</a> and <a href="part8c.xhtml">8C</a> rather than by the provisions of this Chapter. However, many of the treatments outlined in this Chapter are applicable to sidewalks adjacent to highway-rail or highway-LRT grade crossings, including detectable warnings, swing gates, and automatic gates.</span> </p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section8D01_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="support">Crosswalks at intersections where pedestrians cross LRT tracks in mixed-use alignments are covered by the provisions of <a href="part3b.xhtml#section3B18">Section 3B.18</a> rather than by the provisions of this Chapter.</span></p>
