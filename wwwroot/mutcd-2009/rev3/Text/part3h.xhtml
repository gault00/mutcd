Channelizing devices may also be used along a center line to preclude turns or along lane lines to preclude lane changing, as determined by engineering judgment.</span> </p>

On channelizing devices used outside of temporary traffic control zones, retroreflective sheeting or bands shall be white if the devices separate traffic flows in the same direction and shall be yellow if the devices separate traffic flows in the opposite direction or are placed along the left-hand edge line of a one-way roadway or ramp. </span></p>
