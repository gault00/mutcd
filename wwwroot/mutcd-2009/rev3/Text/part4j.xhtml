<h1>Traffic Control for Movable Bridges</h1>
        
        <h3><a name="section4J01"></a>Section 4J.01 Application of Traffic Control for Movable Bridges</h3>
        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span> <br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4J01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Traffic control signals for movable bridges are a special type of highway traffic signal installed at movable bridges to notify road users to stop because of a road closure rather than alternately giving the right-of-way to conflicting traffic movements. The signals are operated in coordination with the opening and closing of the movable bridge, and with the operation of movable bridge warning and resistance gates, or other devices and features used to warn, control, and stop traffic.</span> </p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4J01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Movable bridge warning gates installed at movable bridges decrease the likelihood of vehicles and pedestrians passing the stop line and entering an area where potential hazards exist because of bridge operations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4J01_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="support">A movable bridge resistance gate is sometimes used at movable bridges and located downstream of the movable bridge warning gate. A movable bridge resistance gate provides a physical deterrent to road users when placed in the appropriate position. The movable bridge resistance gates are considered a design feature and not a traffic control device; requirements for them are contained in AASHTO’s “Standard Specifications for Movable Highway Bridges” (see Page i for AASHTO’s address).</span></p>
        <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4J01_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="standard">Traffic control at movable bridges shall include both signals and gates, except in the following cases:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="standard">
          <li>Neither is required if other traffic control devices or measures considered appropriate are used under either of the following conditions: 
            <ol>
              <li>On low-volume roads (roads of less than 400 vehicles average daily traffic), or</li>
              <li>At manually operated bridges if electric power is not available.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Only signals are required in urban areas if intersecting streets or driveways make gates ineffective.</li>
          <li>Only movable bridge warning gates are required if a traffic control signal that is controlled as part of the bridge operations exists within 500 feet of the movable bridge resistance gates and no intervening traffic entrances exist.</li>
        </ol>

The signal shall display a steady red signal indication when traffic is required to stop. The duration of the yellow change interval between the display of the green and steady red signal indications, or flashing yellow and steady red signal indications, shall be determined using engineering practices (see <a href="part4d.xhtml#section4D26">Section 4D.26</a>).</span></p>
