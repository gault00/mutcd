          <span class="paranum"><a name="section2F01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Toll highways are typically limited-access freeway or expressway facilities. A portion of or an entire route might be a toll highway, or a bridge, tunnel, or other crossing point might be the only toll portion of a highway. A toll highway might be a conventional road. The general signing requirements for toll roads will depend on the type of facility and access (freeway, expressway, or conventional road). The provisions of Chapters 2D and 2E will generally apply for guide signs along the toll facility that direct road users within and off the facility where exit points and geometric configurations are not dependent specifically on the collection of tolls. The aspect of tolling and the presence of toll plazas or collection points necessitate additional considerations in the typical signing needs. The notification of the collection of tolls in advance of and at entry points to the toll highway also necessitate additional modifications to the typical signing.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section2F01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">The scope of this Section applies to a route or facility on which all lanes are tolled. Chapter 2G contains provisions for the signing of managed lanes within an otherwise non-toll facility that employ tolling or pricing as an operational strategy to manage congestion levels.</span></p>

Vehicles are typically required to come to a stop to pay the toll or receive a toll ticket in the attended and exact change or automatic lanes. Electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes with favorable geometrics typically allow vehicles to move through the toll plaza without stopping, but usually within a set regulatory speed limit or advisory speed. In some ETC lanes and in most lanes that accommodate non-ETC vehicles, a stop might be required while the ETC payment is processed because of geometric or other conditions.</span></p>
