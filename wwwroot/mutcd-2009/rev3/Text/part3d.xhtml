At direct exits from preferential lanes where extra emphasis is needed, the use of word markings (such as “EXIT” or “EXIT ONLY”) in the deceleration lane for the direct exit and/or on the direct exit ramp itself just beyond the exit gore should be considered.</span></p>

Some reversible preferential lanes on a divided highway might be operated counter-flow to the direction of traffic on the immediately adjacent general purpose lanes.
