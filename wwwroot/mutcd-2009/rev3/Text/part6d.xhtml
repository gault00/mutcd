          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para07"></a>07</span> <span class="guidance">The following three items should be considered when planning for pedestrians in TTC zones:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="guidance">
          <li>Pedestrians should not be led into conflicts with vehicles, equipment, and operations.</li>
          <li>Pedestrians should not be led into conflicts with vehicles moving through or around the worksite.</li>
          <li>Pedestrians should be provided with a convenient and accessible path that replicates as nearly as practical the most desirable characteristics of the existing sidewalk(s) or footpath(s).</li>

        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para08"></a>08</span> <span class="guidance">A pedestrian route should not be severed and/or moved for non-construction activities such as parking for vehicles and equipment.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para09"></a>09</span> <span class="guidance">Consideration should be made to separate pedestrian movements from both worksite activity and vehicular traffic. Unless an acceptable route that does not involve crossing the roadway can be provided, pedestrians should be appropriately directed with advance signing that encourages them to cross to the opposite side of the roadway. In urban and suburban areas with high vehicular traffic volumes, these signs should be placed at intersections (rather than midblock locations) so that pedestrians are not confronted with midblock worksites that will induce them to attempt skirting the worksite or making a midblock crossing.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para11"></a>11</span> <span class="guidance">To accommodate the needs of pedestrians, including those with disabilities, the following considerations should be addressed when temporary pedestrian pathways in TTC zones are designed or modified:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="guidance">
          <li>Provisions for continuity of accessible paths for pedestrians should be incorporated into the TTC plan.</li>
          <li>Access to transit stops should be maintained.</li>
          <li>A smooth, continuous hard surface should be provided throughout the entire length of the temporary pedestrian facility. There should be no curbs or abrupt changes in grade or terrain that could cause tripping or be a barrier to wheelchair use. The geometry and alignment of the facility should meet the applicable requirements of the “Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG)” (see <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A11">Section 1A.11</a>).</li>
          <li>The width of the existing pedestrian facility should be provided for the temporary facility if practical. Traffic control devices and other construction materials and features should not intrude into the usable width of the sidewalk, temporary pathway, or other pedestrian facility. When it is not possible to maintain a minimum width of 60 inches throughout the entire length of the pedestrian pathway, a 60 x 60-inch passing space should be provided at least every 200 feet to allow individuals in wheelchairs to pass.</li>
          <li>Blocked routes, alternate crossings, and sign and signal information should be communicated to pedestrians with visual disabilities by providing devices such as audible information devices, accessible pedestrian signals, or barriers and channelizing devices that are detectable to the pedestrians traveling with the aid of a long cane or who have low vision. Where pedestrian traffic is detoured to a TTC signal, engineering judgment should be used to determine if pedestrian signals or accessible pedestrian signals should be considered for crossings along an alternate route.</li>
          <li>When channelization is used to delineate a pedestrian pathway, a continuous detectable edging should be provided throughout the length of the facility such that pedestrians using a long cane can follow it. These detectable edgings should comply with the provisions of <a href="part6f.xhtml#section6F74">Section 6F.74</a>.</li>
          <li>Signs and other devices mounted lower than 7 feet above the temporary pedestrian pathway should not project more than 4 inches into accessible pedestrian facilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span class="option"><span class="label">Option:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para12"></a>12</span> <span class="option">Whenever it is feasible, closing off the worksite from pedestrian intrusion may be preferable to channelizing pedestrian traffic along the site with TTC devices.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para13"></a>13</span> <span class="guidance">Fencing should not create sight distance restrictions for road users. Fences should not be constructed of materials that would be hazardous if impacted by vehicles. Wooden railing, fencing, and similar systems placed immediately adjacent to motor vehicle traffic should not be used as substitutes for crashworthy temporary traffic barriers.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para14"></a>14</span> <span class="guidance">Ballast for TTC devices should be kept to the minimum amount needed and should be mounted low to prevent penetration of the vehicle windshield.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para15"></a>15</span> <span class="guidance">Movement by work vehicles and equipment across designated pedestrian paths should be minimized and, when necessary, should be controlled by flaggers or TTC. Staging or stopping of work vehicles or equipment along the side of pedestrian paths should be avoided, since it encourages movement of workers, equipment, and materials across the pedestrian path.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6D01_para16"></a>16</span> <span class="guidance">Access to the work space by workers and equipment across pedestrian walkways should be minimized because the access often creates unacceptable changes in grade, and rough or muddy terrain, and pedestrians will tend to avoid these areas by attempting non-intersection crossings where no curb ramps are available.</span></p>

Devices that provide speech messages in response to passive pedestrian actuation are the most desirable. Other devices that continuously emit a message, or that emit a message in response to use of a pushbutton, are also acceptable. signing information can also be transmitted to personal receivers, but currently such receivers are not likely to be carried or used by pedestrians with visual disabilities in TTC zones. Audible information devices might not be needed if detectable channelizing devices make an alternate route of travel evident to pedestrians with visual disabilities.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6D03_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Equally as important as the safety of road users traveling through the TTC zone is the safety of workers. TTC zones present temporary and constantly changing conditions that are unexpected by the road user. This creates an even higher degree of vulnerability for workers on or near the roadway.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6D03_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Maintaining TTC zones with road user flow inhibited as little as possible, and using TTC devices that get the road user’s attention and provide positive direction are of particular importance. Likewise, equipment and vehicles moving within the activity area create a risk to workers on foot. When possible, the separation of moving equipment and construction vehicles from workers on foot provides the operator of these vehicles with a greater separation clearance and improved sight lines to minimize exposure to the hazards of moving vehicles and equipment.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6D03_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="guidance">The following are the key elements of worker safety and TTC management that should be considered to improve worker safety:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="guidance">
          <li>Training—all workers should be trained on how to work next to motor vehicle traffic in a way that minimizes their vulnerability. Workers having specific TTC responsibilities should be trained in TTC techniques, device usage, and placement.</li>
          <li>Temporary Traffic Barriers—temporary traffic barriers should be placed along the work space depending on factors such as lateral clearance of workers from adjacent traffic, speed of traffic, duration and type of operations, time of day, and volume of traffic.</li>
          <li>Speed Reduction—reducing the speed of vehicular traffic, mainly through regulatory speed zoning, funneling, lane reduction, or the use of uniformed law enforcement officers or flaggers, should be considered.</li>
          <li>Activity Area—planning the internal work activity area to minimize backing-up maneuvers of construction vehicles should be considered to minimize the exposure to risk.</li>
          <li>Worker Safety Planning—a trained person designated by the employer should conduct a basic hazard assessment for the worksite and job classifications required in the activity area. This safety professional should determine whether engineering, administrative, or personal protection measures should be implemented. This plan should be in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, “General Duty Clause” Section 5(a)(1) - Public Law 91-596, 84 Stat. 1590, December 29, 1970, as amended, and with the requirement to assess worker risk exposures for each job site and job classification, as per 29 CFR 1926.20 (b)(2) of “Occupational Safety and Health Administration Regulations, General Safety and Health Provisions” (see <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A11">Section 1A.11</a>).</li>
