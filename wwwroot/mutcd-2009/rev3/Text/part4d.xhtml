          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4D01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">The features of traffic control signals of interest to road users are the location, design, and meaning of the signal indications. Uniformity in the design features that affect the traffic to be controlled, as set forth in this Manual, is especially important for the safety and efficiency of operations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4D01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Traffic control signals can be operated in pretimed, semi-actuated, or full-actuated modes. For isolated (non-interconnected) signalized locations on rural high-speed highways, full-actuated mode with advance vehicle detection on the high-speed approaches is typically used. These features are designed to reduce the frequency with which the onset of the yellow change interval is displayed when high-speed approaching vehicles are in the “dilemma zone” such that the drivers of these high-speed vehicles find it difficult to decide whether to stop or proceed.</span> </p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4D01_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="standard">When a traffic control signal is not in operation, such as before it is placed in service, during seasonal shutdowns, or when it is not desirable to operate the traffic control signal, the signal faces shall be covered, turned, or taken down to clearly indicate that the traffic control signal is not in operation.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4D01_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="support">Seasonal shutdown is a condition in which a permanent traffic signal is turned off or otherwise made non-operational during a particular season when its operation is not justified. This might be applied in a community where tourist traffic during most of the year justifies the permanent signalization, but a seasonal shutdown of the signal during an annual period of lower tourist traffic would reduce delays; or where a major traffic generator, such as a large factory, justifies the permanent signalization, but the large factory is shut down for an annual factory vacation for a few weeks in the summer. </span></p>
