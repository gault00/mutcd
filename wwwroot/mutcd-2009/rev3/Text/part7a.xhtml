<h1>Chapter 7A. General</h1>
        
        <h3><a name="section7A01"></a>Section 7A.01 Need for Standards</h3>
        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/>
          </span><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Regardless of the school location, the best way to achieve effective traffic control is through the uniform application of realistic policies, practices, and standards developed through engineering judgment or studies.</span> </p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Pedestrian safety depends upon public understanding of accepted methods for efficient traffic control. This principle is especially important in the control of pedestrians, bicycles, and other vehicles in the vicinity of schools. Neither pedestrians on their way to or from school nor other road users can be expected to move safely in school areas unless they understand both the need for traffic controls and how these controls function for their benefit.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="support">Procedures and devices that are not uniform might cause confusion among pedestrians and other road users, prompt wrong decisions, and contribute to crashes. To achieve uniformity of traffic control in school areas, comparable traffic situations need to be treated in a consistent manner. Each traffic control device and control method described in <a href="part7_toc.html">Part 7</a> fulfills a specific function related to specific traffic conditions.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="support">A uniform approach to school area traffic controls assures the use of similar controls for similar situations, which promotes appropriate and uniform behavior on the part of motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para05"></a>05</span> <span class="support">A school traffic control plan permits the orderly review of school area traffic control needs, and the coordination of school/pedestrian safety education and engineering measures. Engineering measures alone do not always result in the intended change in student and road user behavior.</span> </p>
        <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span><br/>
          </span><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para06"></a>06</span> <span class="guidance">A school route plan for each school serving elementary to high school students should be prepared in order to develop uniformity in the use of school area traffic controls and to serve as the basis for a school traffic control plan for each school.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para07"></a>07</span> <span class="guidance">The school route plan, developed in a systematic manner by the school, law enforcement, and traffic officials responsible for school pedestrian safety, should consist of a map (see <a href="#figure7A01">Figure 7A-1</a>) showing streets, the school, existing traffic controls, established school walk routes, and established school crossings.</span></p>

        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para08"></a>08</span> <span class="guidance">The type(s) of school area traffic control devices used, either warning or regulatory, should be related to the volume and speed of vehicular traffic, street width, and the number and age of the students using the crossing.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para09"></a>09</span> <span class="guidance">School area traffic control devices should be included in a school traffic control plan.</span></p>

          </span><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para10"></a>10</span> <span class="support">Reduced speed limit signs for school areas and crossings are included in this Manual solely for the purpose of standardizing signing for these zones and not as an endorsement of mandatory reduced speed zones.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A01_para11"></a>11</span> <span class="support">“School” and “school zone” are defined in <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A13">Section 1A.13</a>.</span></p>
        <h3><a name="section7A02"></a>Section 7A.02 School Routes and Established School Crossings</h3>
        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/>
          </span><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A02_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">To establish a safer route to and from school for schoolchildren, the application of planning criterion for school walk routes might make it necessary for children to walk an indirect route to an established school crossing located where there is existing traffic control and to avoid the use of a direct crossing where there is no existing traffic control.</span></p>
        <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span><br/>
          </span><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A02_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="guidance">School walk routes should be planned to take advantage of existing traffic controls.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A02_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="guidance">The following factors should be considered when determining the feasibility of requiring children to walk a longer distance to a crossing with existing traffic control:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="guidance">
          <li>The availability of adequate sidewalks or other pedestrian walkways to and from the location with existing control,</li>
          <li>The number of students using the crossing,</li>
          <li>The age levels of the students using the crossing, and</li>
          <li>The total extra walking distance.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3><a name="section7A03"></a>Section 7A.03 School Crossing Control Criteria </h3>
        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span><br/>
          </span><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A03_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">The frequency of gaps in the traffic stream that are sufficient for student crossing is different at each crossing location. When the delay between the occurrences of adequate gaps becomes excessive, students might become impatient and endanger themselves by attempting to cross the street during an inadequate gap. In these instances, the creation of sufficient gaps needs to be considered to accommodate the crossing demand.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section7A03_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">A recommended method for determining the frequency and adequacy of gaps in the traffic stream is given in the “Traffic Control Devices Handbook” (see <a href="part1a.xhtml#section1A11">Section 1A.11</a>).</span></p>
