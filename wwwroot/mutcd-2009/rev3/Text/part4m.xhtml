          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4M01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Lane-use control signals are special overhead signals that permit or prohibit the use of specific lanes of a street or highway or that indicate the impending prohibition of their use. Lane-use control signals are distinguished by placement of special signal faces over a certain lane or lanes of the roadway and by their distinctive shapes and symbols. Supplementary signs are sometimes used to explain their meaning and intent.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Lane-use control signals are most commonly used for reversible-lane control, but are also used in certain non-reversible lane applications and for toll plaza lanes (see Section 4K.02).</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4M01_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="guidance">An engineering study should be conducted to determine whether a reversible-lane operation can be controlled satisfactorily by static signs (see <a href="part2b.xhtml#section2B26">Section 2B.26</a>) or whether lane-use control signals are necessary. Lane-use control signals should be used to control reversible-lane operations if any of the following conditions are present:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="guidance">
          <li>More than one lane is reversed in direction;</li>
          <li>Two-way or one-way left turns are allowed during peak-period reversible operations, but those turns are from a different lane than used during off-peak periods;</li>
          <li>Other unusual or complex operations are included in the reversible-lane pattern;</li>
          <li>Demonstrated crash experience occurring with reversible-lane operation controlled by static signs that can be corrected by using lane-use control signals at the times of transition between peak and off-peak patterns; and/or</li>
          <li>An engineering study indicates that the safety and efficiency of the traffic operations of a reversible-lane system would be improved by lane-use control signals.</li>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4M01_para05"></a>05</span> <span class="option">Lane-use control signals may also be used if there is no intent or need to reverse lanes, but there is a need to indicate the open or closed status of one or more lanes, such as:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="option">
          <li>On a freeway, if it is desired to close certain lanes at certain hours to facilitate the merging of traffic from a ramp or other freeway;</li>
          <li>On a freeway, near its terminus, to indicate a lane that ends;</li>
          <li>On a freeway or long bridge, to indicate that a lane may be temporarily blocked by a crash, breakdown, construction or maintenance activities, or similar temporary conditions; and</li>
          <li>On a conventional road or driveway, at access or egress points to or from a facility, such as a parking garage, where one or more lanes of the access or egress are opened or closed at various times.</li>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4M02_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="standard">The meanings of lane-use control signal indications shall be as follows:</span></p>
        <ol type="A" class="standard">
          <li>A steady DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW signal indication shall mean that a road user is permitted to drive in the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.</li>
          <li>A steady YELLOW X signal indication shall mean that a road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being made to a steady RED X signal indication.</li>
          <li>A steady WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW signal indication (see <a href="#figure4M01">Figure 4M-1</a>) shall mean that a road user is permitted to use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by oncoming road users for left turns is also permitted.</li>
          <li>A steady WHITE ONE WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW signal indication (see <a href="#figure4M01">Figure 4M-1</a>) shall mean that a road user is permitted to use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn (without opposing turns in the same lane), but not for through travel.</li>
          <li>A steady RED X signal indication shall mean that a road user is not permitted to use the lane over which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.</li>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="standard">All lane-use control signal indications shall be in units with rectangular signal faces and shall have opaque backgrounds. Nominal minimum height and width of each DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW, YELLOW X, and RED X signal face shall be 18 inches for typical applications. The WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW and WHITE ONE WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW signal faces shall have a nominal minimum height and width of 30 inches.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="standard">Each lane to be reversed or closed shall have signal faces with a DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW and a RED X symbol.</span></p>

        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="standard">Each non-reversible lane immediately adjacent to a reversible lane shall have signal indications that display a DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW to traffic traveling in the permitted direction and a RED X to traffic traveling in the opposite direction.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para05"></a>05</span> <span class="standard">If in separate signal sections, the relative positions, from left to right, of the signal indications shall be RED X, YELLOW X, DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW, WHITE TWO-WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW, WHITE ONE WAY LEFT-TURN ARROW.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para06"></a>06</span> <span class="standard">The color of lane-use control signal indications shall be clearly visible for 2,300 feet at all times under normal atmospheric conditions, unless otherwise physically obstructed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para07"></a>07</span> <span class="standard">Lane-use control signal faces shall be located approximately over the center of the lane controlled.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para08"></a>08</span> <span class="standard">If the area to be controlled is more than 2,300 feet in length, or if the vertical or horizontal alignment is curved, intermediate lane-use control signal faces shall be located over each controlled lane at frequent intervals. This location shall be such that road users will at all times be able to see at least one signal indication and preferably two along the roadway, and will have a definite indication of the lanes specifically reserved for their use.</span></p>

        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para10"></a>10</span> <span class="standard">On roadways having intersections controlled by traffic control signals, the lane-use control signal face shall be located sufficiently far in advance of or beyond such traffic control signals to prevent them from being misconstrued as traffic control signals.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para11"></a>11</span> <span class="standard">Except as provided in <a href="#section4M03_para12">Paragraph 12</a>, the bottom of the signal housing of any lane-use control signal face shall be a minimum of 15 feet and a maximum of 19 feet above the pavement grade.</span></p>

        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para14"></a>14</span> <span class="option">Other sizes of lane-use control signal faces larger than 18 inches with message recognition distances appropriate to signal spacing may be used for the DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW, YELLOW X, and RED X signal faces.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para15"></a>15</span> <span class="option">Non-reversible lanes not immediately adjacent to a reversible lane on any street so controlled may also be provided with signal indications that display a DOWNWARD GREEN ARROW to traffic traveling in the permitted direction and a RED X to traffic traveling in the opposite direction.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4M03_para16"></a>16</span> <span class="option">The signal indications provided for each lane may be in separate signal sections or may be superimposed in the same signal section.</span></p>
