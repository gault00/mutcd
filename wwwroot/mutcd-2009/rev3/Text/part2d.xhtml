          <span class="paranum"><a name="section2D02_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Guide signs are essential to direct road users along streets and highways, to inform them of intersecting routes, to direct them to cities, towns, villages, or other important destinations, to identify nearby rivers and streams, parks, forests, and historical sites, and generally to give such information as will help them along their way in the most simple, direct manner possible.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section2D02_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">Chapter 2A addresses placement, location, and other general criteria for signs.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section2D03_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="support">Color coding is sometimes used to help road users distinguish between multiple potentially confusing destinations. Examples of valuable uses of color coding include guide signs for roadways approaching or inside an airport property with multiple terminals serving multiple airlines, and community wayfinding guide signs for various traffic generator destinations within a community or area.</span></p>

The color coding shall be accomplished by the use of different colored square or rectangular sign panels on the face of the guide signs.</span></p>
