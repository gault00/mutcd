<h1>6C. Temporary Traffic Control Elements</h1>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">A TTC plan describes TTC measures to be used for facilitating road users through a work zone or an incident area. TTC plans play a vital role in providing continuity of effective road user flow when a work zone, incident, or other event temporarily disrupts normal road user flow. Important auxiliary provisions that cannot conveniently be specified on project plans can easily be incorporated into Special Provisions within the TTC plan.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">TTC plans range in scope from being very detailed to simply referencing typical drawings contained in this Manual, standard approved highway agency drawings and manuals, or specific drawings contained in the contract documents. The degree of detail in the TTC plan depends entirely on the nature and complexity of the situation.</span></p>
        <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="guidance">TTC plans should be prepared by persons knowledgeable (for example, trained and/or certified) about the fundamental principles of TTC and work activities to be performed. The design, selection, and placement of TTC devices for a TTC plan should be based on engineering judgment.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="guidance">Coordination should be made between adjacent or overlapping projects to check that duplicate signing is not used and to check compatibility of traffic control between adjacent or overlapping projects.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para05"></a>05</span> <span class="guidance">Traffic control planning should be completed for all highway construction, utility work, maintenance operations, and incident management including minor maintenance and utility projects prior to occupying the TTC zone. Planning for all road users should be included in the process.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para06"></a>06</span> <span class="guidance">Provisions for effective continuity of accessible circulation paths for pedestrians should be incorporated into the TTC process. Where existing pedestrian routes are blocked or detoured, information should be provided about alternative routes that are usable by pedestrians with disabilities, particularly those who have visual disabilities. Access to temporary bus stops, travel across intersections with accessible pedestrian signals (see <a href="part4e.xhtml#section4E09">Section 4E.09</a>), and other routing issues should be considered where temporary pedestrian routes are channelized. Barriers and channelizing devices that are detectable by people with visual disabilities should be provided.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para07"></a>07</span> <span class="option">Provisions may be incorporated into the project bid documents that enable contractors to develop an alternate TTC plan.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para08"></a>08</span> <span class="option">Modifications of TTC plans may be necessary because of changed conditions or a determination of better methods of safely and efficiently handling road users.</span></p>
        <p><span class="guidance"><span class="label">Guidance:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para09"></a>09</span> <span class="guidance">This alternate or modified plan should have the approval of the responsible highway agency prior to implementation.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para10"></a>10</span> <span class="guidance">Provisions for effective continuity of transit service should be incorporated into the TTC planning process because often public transit buses cannot efficiently be detoured in the same manner as other vehicles (particularly for short-term maintenance projects). Where applicable, the TTC plan should provide for features such as accessible temporary bus stops, pull-outs, and satisfactory waiting areas for transit patrons, including persons with disabilities, if applicable (see <a href="part8a.xhtml#section8A08">Section 8A.08</a> for additional light rail transit issues to consider for TTC).</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para11"></a>11</span> <span class="guidance">Provisions for effective continuity of railroad service and acceptable access to abutting property owners and businesses should also be incorporated into the TTC planning process.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para12"></a>12</span> <span class="guidance">Reduced speed limits should be used only in the specific portion of the TTC zone where conditions or restrictive features are present. However, frequent changes in the speed limit should be avoided. A TTC plan should be designed so that vehicles can travel through the TTC zone with a speed limit reduction of no more than 10 mph.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para13"></a>13</span> <span class="guidance">A reduction of more than 10 mph in the speed limit should be used only when required by restrictive features in the TTC zone. Where restrictive features justify a speed reduction of more than 10 mph, additional driver notification should be provided. The speed limit should be stepped down in advance of the location requiring the lowest speed, and additional TTC warning devices should be used.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para14"></a>14</span> <span class="guidance">Reduced speed zoning (lowering the regulatory speed limit) should be avoided as much as practical because drivers will reduce their speeds only if they clearly perceive a need to do so.</span></p>
        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C01_para15"></a>15</span> <span class="support">Research has demonstrated that large reductions in the speed limit, such as a 30 mph reduction, increase speed variance and the potential for crashes. Smaller reductions in the speed limit of up to 10 mph cause smaller changes in speed variance and lessen the potential for increased crashes. A reduction in the regulatory speed limit of only up to 10 mph from the normal speed limit has been shown to be more effective.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C02_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">A TTC zone is an area of a highway where road user conditions are changed because of a work zone, an incident zone, or a planned special event through the use of TTC devices, uniformed law enforcement officers, or other authorized personnel.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C02_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">A work zone is an area of a highway with construction, maintenance, or utility work activities. A work zone is typically marked by signs, channelizing devices, barriers, pavement markings, and/or work vehicles. It extends from the first warning sign or high-intensity rotating, flashing, oscillating, or strobe lights on a vehicle to the END ROAD WORK sign or the last TTC device.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C02_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="support">An incident zone is an area of a highway where temporary traffic controls are imposed by authorized officials in response to a traffic incident (see <a href="part6i.xhtml#section6I01">Section 6I.01</a>). It extends from the first warning device (such as a sign, light, or cone) to the last TTC device or to a point where road users return to the original lane alignment and are clear of the incident.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C02_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="support">A planned special event often creates the need to establish altered traffic patterns to handle the increased traffic volumes generated by the event. The size of the TTC zone associated with a planned special event can be small, such as closing a street for a festival, or can extend throughout a municipality for larger events. The duration of the TTC zone is determined by the duration of the planned special event.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C03_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Most TTC zones are divided into four areas: the advance warning area, the transition area, the activity area, and the termination area. <a href="#figure6C01">Figure 6C-1</a> illustrates these four areas. These four areas are described in <a href="#section6C04">Sections 6C.04</a> through <a href="#section6C07">6C.07</a>.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C04_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">The advance warning area is the section of highway where road users are informed about the upcoming work zone or incident area.</span></p>

          <span class="paranum"><a name="section6C04_para03"></a>03</span> <span class="guidance">Typical distances for placement of advance warning signs on freeways and expressways should be longer because drivers are conditioned to uninterrupted flow. Therefore, the advance warning sign placement should extend on these facilities as far as 1/2 mile or more.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section6C04_para04"></a>04</span><span class="guidance"> On urban streets, the effective placement of the first warning sign in feet should range from 4 to 8 times the speed limit in mph, with the high end of the range being used when speeds are relatively high. When a single advance warning sign is used (in cases such as low-speed residential streets), the advance warning area can be as short as 100 feet. When two or more advance warning signs are used on higher-speed streets, such as major arterials, the advance warning area should extend a greater distance (see <a href="#table6C01">Table 6C-1</a>).</span></p>
