          <span class="paranum"><a name="section3J01_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Longitudinal rumble strips consist of a series of rough-textured or slightly raised or depressed road surfaces intended to alert inattentive drivers through vibration and sound that their vehicle has left the travel lane. Shoulder rumble strips are typically installed along the shoulder near the travel lane. On divided highways, rumble strips are sometimes installed on the median side (left-hand side) shoulder as well as on the outside (right-hand side) shoulder. On two-way roadways, rumble strips are sometimes installed along the center line.</span> </p>

The provisions in this Manual address the use of markings in combination with a longitudinal rumble strip.</span></p>

        <h3><a name="section3J02"></a>Section 3J.02 Transverse Rumble Strip Markings</h3>
        <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/>
          <span class="paranum"><a name="section3J02_para01"></a>01</span> <span class="support">Transverse rumble strips consist of intermittent narrow, transverse areas of rough-textured or slightly raised or depressed road surface that extend across the travel lanes to alert drivers to unusual vehicular traffic conditions. Through noise and vibration, they attract the attention of road users to features such as unexpected changes in alignment and conditions requiring a reduction in speed or a stop.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section3J02_para02"></a>02</span> <span class="support">This Manual contains no provisions regarding the design and placement of transverse rumble strips that approximate the color of the pavement. The provisions in this Manual address the use of markings in combination with a transverse rumble strip.</span></p>
