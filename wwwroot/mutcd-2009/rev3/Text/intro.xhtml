  <h1>Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices<br/>Introduction</h1>

  <p><span class="standard"><span class="label">Standard:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum">01</span> <span class="standard">Traffic control devices shall be defined as all signs, signals, markings, and other devices used to regulate, warn, or guide traffic, placed on, over, or adjacent to a street, highway, pedestrian facility, bikeway, or private road open to public travel (see definition in Section 1A.13) by authority of a public agency or official having jurisdiction, or, in the case of a private road, by authority of the private owner or private official having jurisdiction.</span></p>

  <p><span class="paranum">02</span> <span class="standard">The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) is incorporated by reference in 23 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 655, Subpart F and shall be recognized as the national standard for all traffic control devices installed on any street, highway, bikeway, or private road open to public travel (see definition in Section 1A.13) in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 109(d) and 402(a). The policies and procedures of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to obtain basic uniformity of traffic control devices shall be as described in 23 CFR 655, Subpart F.</span></p>

  <p><span class="paranum">03</span> <span class="standard">In accordance with 23 CFR 655.603(a), for the purposes of applicability of the MUTCD:</span></p>

  <ol type="A" class="standard">
    <li>Toll roads under the jurisdiction of public agencies or authorities or public-private partnerships shall be considered to be public highways;</li>

    <li>Private roads open to public travel shall be as defined in Section 1A.13; and</li>

    <li>Parking areas, including the driving aisles within those parking areas, that are either publicly or privately owned shall not be considered to be “open to public travel” for purposes of MUTCD applicability.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><span class="paranum">04</span> <span class="standard">Any traffic control device design or application provision contained in this Manual shall be considered to be in the public domain. Traffic control devices contained in this Manual shall not be protected by a patent, trademark, or copyright, except for the Interstate Shield and any items owned by FHWA.</span></p>

  <p><span class="support"><span class="label">Support:</span></span><br/> <span class="paranum">05</span> <span class="support">Pictographs, as defined in Section 1A.13, are embedded in traffic control devices but the pictographs themselves are not considered traffic control devices for the purposes of Paragraph 4.</span></p>

  <p><span class="paranum">06</span> <span class="support">The need for uniform standards was recognized long ago. The American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO), now known as the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), published a manual for rural highways in 1927, and the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety (NCSHS) published a manual for urban streets in 1930. In the early years, the necessity for unification of the standards applicable to the different classes of road and street systems was obvious. To meet this need, a joint committee of AASHO and NCSHS developed and published the original edition of this Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) in 1935. That committee, now called the National Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (NCUTCD), though changed from time to time in name, organization, and personnel, has been in continuous existence and has contributed to periodic revisions of this Manual. The FHWA has administered the MUTCD since the 1971 edition. The FHWA and its predecessor organizations have participated in the development and publishing of the previous editions. There were nine previous editions of the MUTCD, and several of those editions were revised one or more times. <a href="#tableI01">Table I-1</a> traces the evolution of the MUTCD, including the two manuals developed by AASHO and NCSHS. </span></p>
