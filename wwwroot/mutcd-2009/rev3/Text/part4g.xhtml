          <span class="paranum"><a name="section4G01_para04"></a>04</span> <span class="guidance">If a traffic control signal is not justified under the signal warrants of <a href="part4c.xhtml">Chapter 4C</a> and if gaps in traffic are not adequate to permit the timely entrance of emergency vehicles, or the stopping sight distance for vehicles approaching on the major street is insufficient for emergency vehicles, installing an emergency-vehicle traffic control signal should be considered. If one of the signal warrants of <a href="part4c.xhtml">Chapter 4C</a> is met and a traffic control signal is justified by an engineering study, and if a decision is made to install a traffic control signal, it should be installed based upon the provisions of <a href="part4d.xhtml">Chapter 4D</a>.</span></p>
        <p><span class="paranum"><a name="section4G01_para05"></a>05</span> <span class="guidance">The sight distance determination should be based on the location of the visibility obstruction for the critical approach lane for each street or drive and the posted or statutory speed limit or 85th-percentile speed on the major street, whichever is higher.</span></p>
